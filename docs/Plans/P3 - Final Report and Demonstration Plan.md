# P3 – Final Report and Demonstration Plan

## Final Report Structure
- Change this to be similar to the structure of the literature review
	- Provided structure is more for software engineering projects
- Introduce methods at the start vs. introduce methods as they're used
	- Whatever is easier to navigate

### Introduction – Background and Aim

### Preliminary Research
- How much should this differ from the literature review?
	- Should it contain a subset of this, alongside new findings during development?
### Analysis of Requirements
- How much should this differ from the literature review?
	- Include new findings about difficulties with big data
### Design
- How does this work? In our case, how does it differ from analysis of requirements?
### Development

### Evaluation

### Conclusions
- Limitations
	- Challenges in collecting and parsing data – may be difficult for future work
- What worked
- What didn't work
- What we didn't explore but could be useful in the future
### References/Appendices

## Demonstration
- Recorded video
- Presentation – introducing the project
- Demonstration of code
	- Print different steps to show something to the viewers
- Demonstration of results
