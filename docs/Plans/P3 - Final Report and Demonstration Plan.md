# P3 – Final Report and Demonstration Plan

## Submission
- Deadline of 3rd May
- Final report and slides in a .zip file
- Last page of the slides must contain the link to the presentation video on a file sharing website
- Last page of the slides should also contain the link to your code on a file sharing website
	- Only submit source code produced by you – don't need to upload any libraries that have been used
		- If you use C code, provide instructions for how they can compile it
	- Include a README describing how the code works
- Submission system has 100MB size limitation of uploaded files
### Demo Video
- Deadline of 4th May
	- No changes to the video after the submission deadline
- 20 minutes long
	- 3-5 minutes – brief introduction for your project with slides
	- 15 minutes – demonstration of the system
		- Print different steps to show something to the viewers
- Ensure the supervisor and second marker have access to the work
- Marked by two independent markers based on the mark scheme
- Written feedback at the end of the academic year

## Structure of the Report
### Template
- No requirement to use the template provided on ELE
	- Using your own template is fine as long as it meets the requirements
### Title Page
- Use the one provided on ELE
### Table of Contents
- No summary of literature review required
- Try to avoid sub-subsections
- No sub-sub-subsections
### Body of the Report
- 20 pages in length
	- Doesn't include title page, table of contents, and references
- Single-spaced
- Minimum font size 11 pt
	- Tables and figures can have a minimum font size of 9 pt
- Margins of 2cm on each size
### References
- Include them if necessary
	- No literature review section, so may not need to cite all of the sources previously used
### Appendices (optional)
- Don't contribute to the assessment
	- Main results and evidence for them must be included int he body of the report
- May be used to present experimental data, UML diagrams, data-flow diagrams, user manuals, screenshots and others for the sake of completeness

## Example Structure
1. Introduction
2. Project specification
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Description of the final project
7. Evaluation of the final project
8. Critical assessment of the project as a whole
9. Conclusion

## Final Report Plan
- Change this to be similar to the structure of the literature review
	- Provided structure is more for software engineering projects
- Introduce methods at the start vs. introduce methods as they're used
	- Whatever is easier to navigate

### Introduction – Background and Aim

### Preliminary Research
- How much should this differ from the literature review?
	- Should it contain a subset of this, alongside new findings during development?
### Analysis of Requirements
- How much should this differ from the literature review?
	- Include new findings about difficulties with big data
### Design
- How does this work? In our case, how does it differ from analysis of requirements?
### Development

### Evaluation

### Conclusions
- Limitations
	- Challenges in collecting and parsing data – may be difficult for future work
- What worked
- What didn't work
- What we didn't explore but could be useful in the future
### References/Appendices
