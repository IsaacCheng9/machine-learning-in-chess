# P3 – Final Report and Demonstration Plan

## Final Report Plan
### Project Specification, Motivations, and Aims
#### Project Specification
- Essentially a summary of the introduction
#### Motivation and Aims
- Contain a subset of literature review alongside new findings during development
- Early history of computer chess
	- Couple of sentences
- Modern developments in computer chess
	- May not be as relevant – keep it short
- Growth in the popularity of chess
	- Fast growth gives increasing amounts and better quality data to train on
- Practical uses of chess databases
	- Link to how results of our studies can contribute to the landscape of chess
	- [FICS Games Database](https://www.ficsgames.org/) provides PGN files with different game metadata, but it isn’t as popular of a platform for playing chess games
### Design, Methods, and Implementation
- Downloading the data
- Data processing
- Subsampling for ML models
### Project Results and Evaluation
- Development → results → evaluation for each finding
### Project Discussion and Conclusion
- ~3 pages
#### Project Outcomes
- What worked
#### Limitations
- What didn't work
- Challenges in collecting and parsing data – may be difficult for future work
#### Future Work
- Change pipeline to account for different database such as FICS Games Database
- What we didn't explore but could be useful in the future
### References
### Appendices
- Examples of things like chess openings

## Submission
- Deadline of 3rd May
- Final report and slides in a .zip file
- Last page of the slides must contain the link to the presentation video on a file sharing website
- Last page of the slides should also contain the link to your code on a file sharing website
	- Only submit source code produced by you – don't need to upload any libraries that have been used
		- If you use C code, provide instructions for how they can compile it
	- Include a README describing how the code works
- Submission system has 100MB size limitation of uploaded files
### Demo Video
- Deadline of 4th May
	- No changes to the video after the submission deadline
- 20 minutes long
	- 3-5 minutes – brief introduction for your project with slides
	- 15 minutes – demonstration of the system
		- Print different steps to show something to the viewers
- Ensure the supervisor and second marker have access to the work
- Marked by two independent markers based on the mark scheme
- Written feedback at the end of the academic year

## Structure of the Report
### Template
- No requirement to use the template provided on ELE
	- Using your own template is fine as long as it meets the requirements
### Title Page
- Use the one provided on ELE
### Table of Contents
- No summary of literature review required
- Try to avoid sub-subsections
- No sub-sub-subsections
### Body of the Report
- 20 pages in length
	- Doesn't include title page, table of contents, and references
- Single-spaced
- Minimum font size 11 pt
	- Tables and figures can have a minimum font size of 9 pt
- Margins of 2cm on each size
### References
- Include them if necessary
	- No literature review section, so may not need to cite all of the sources previously used
### Appendices (optional)
- Don't contribute to the assessment
	- Main results and evidence for them must be included int he body of the report
- May be used to present experimental data, UML diagrams, data-flow diagrams, user manuals, screenshots and others for the sake of completeness
