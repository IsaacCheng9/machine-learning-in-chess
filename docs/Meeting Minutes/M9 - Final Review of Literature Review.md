# M9 – Final Review of Literature Review

## Agenda
- How specific do I need to be in the project management section regarding plans on models that I'll be using?
	- Particularly in 'Analysing the Data' subsection
- Confused about evaluation section
	- Difference between evaluating our model and evaluating our project?
- Does my literature review have a lack of depth that I need to address?
	- Especially in sections 'Analysing the Data' and 'Evaluation'
- Is it a concern that most of my references are online resources?
	- Most of the information that I cited couldn't be found from academic papers
## Feedback
- Need more detail in Analysing the Data
	- What analyses are we going to run?
		- Like the social learning theory example, but more of that
		- Examples:
			- Using frequency of openings to predict Elo ratings
			- Cluster strategies into player types
			- Cluster games based on the types of moves that are played
				- Open-ended games and closed games
					- Bishops are better in open-ended games whereas knights are better in closed games
					- Quantify the difference between these
		- Regression
		- Classification
- Explain why allegations of cheating are relevant to our research
	- Frame the section as the practical use of chess databases
		- The patterns that we find could be used to identify players who are cheating
			- If their playstyle doesn't fit into patterns we've found, we could try to find the likelihood that they're cheating
			- If they don't fit in clusters of players (similar to finding 'top-right Messi')
				- Finding parameter space of chess players – x and y-axes
				- Players who are close together in clustering play similarly to each other, and vice versa
	- Look into Kenneth Regan's academic papers
- Evaluation
	- Need to add evaluation methods for regression
	- Evaluate the project based on:
		- The results from evaluating model
		- Whether we have found patterns in how players use chess strategies
		- Models may have good evaluation results, yet we're unable to find patterns
- Remember to connect preliminary research to the project
	- Link the patterns they're extracting into how we can use it for our analysis
	- Add a subsection about the relevance of computer chess to our project
- Preliminary research topics:
	- Could remove the history of how computer chess started etc, as they aren't directly relevant – nice-to-haves
	- Growth in the popularity of chess
		- Could delve into some of the research performed about chess openings, but they're very simple, lack depth, and aren't formal academic pieces of research
		- May not need to investigate more breadth – just focus on how there's interest
	- Explain how piece valuation works and how it was defined, but not the entire history
	- Don't need to add subsection on social learning theory
		- Could risk overwhelming the project – avoid scope creep
- Conclusion
	- Briefly mention some of the methods we could use
		- Focus on the prediction/clustering methods as opposed to the evaluation
		- 'identify patterns in how people play chess, such as...'
	- Mention more potential outcomes of this project:
		- Detecting cheating in chess
- Final refinements (to do at the end)
	- Formatting of formulas (could be explained in-text as the ratio rather than showing the math formulas)
	- Figures:
		- Queen's Gambit popularity
		- French win ratio
		- What the French opening looks like
