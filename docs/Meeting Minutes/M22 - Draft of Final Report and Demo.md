# M22 – Draft of Final Report and Demo (02/05/2023)

## Progress
- Completed subsection on clustering openings by the differences of results in their variations.
- Improved project specification section.
	- Broke the bullet point objectives down to be more specific.
	- Added a paragraph at the end of the subsection on the early history of computer chess to relate it to my project.
- Completed project discussion and conclusion section.
- Improved phrasing of parts of my final report.
- Created slides for presentation.
- Recorded voiceovers for all slides in the presentation.
- Added a section to the README that mentions the pre-processed data set that we’ve provided.

## Questions
- Are there any other areas of my report that I could improve? What are the weakest aspects of my report?
	- Group the objectives with subheadings (bold).
		- Data collection and processing – 1-3
		- Machine learning techniques – 4-7
		- Model analysis and evaluation – 8-9
	- Move motivations and aims before project specification.
	- Add a subsection (2.4?) with a paragraph explaining what machine learning techniques we’ll be using.
		- Name the methods, what they’re used for, etc.
		- Move the explanation of the methods from results section to the new subsection.
- Is the referencing in my slides okay?
	- Looks good – no changes
- How thorough do I need to be in my code demo part of the presentation?
	- Is ~10 minutes on the slides and ~10 minutes for the code demo a reasonable split?
		- Good split – code demo may not even take 10 minutes long
- General advice about Learning From Data exam – should we be expected to be able to recite the equations and definitions (e.g. [[L3 - Measures of Error and Regression Models]], or is a general understanding of the concepts and what the equations mean sufficient?
	- General understanding
