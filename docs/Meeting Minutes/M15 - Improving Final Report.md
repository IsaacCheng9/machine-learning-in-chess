# M15 – Improving Final Report (02/03/2023)

## Progress
- Added citations for design section.
- Improved the readability of the data pipeline diagram.
- Improved the plots from initial data exploration.
- Briefly explained the data pipeline.
- Started a subsection on initial data exploration.
	- Explained the distribution of player ratings.

## Questions
- Are the citations for the libraries written appropriately?
	- Yes, as long as links are included for sources that aren’t implicit
- Does my explanation of the data pipeline contain enough detail?
	- Rephrase slightly
- Should I include plots as a figure?
	- Currently only added them as images to avoid title repetition – could remove the title in the pandas plot and then convert the images to figures with the title instead?
		- Better to include them as figures than standalone images
- Is the level of detail in my current explanations of data analysis appropriate?
	- Should I continue to use this amount of detail for future analysis (bearing in mind page limit)?
		- Level of detail is good
