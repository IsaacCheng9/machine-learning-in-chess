# M8 – Adding Preliminary Research to Literature Review (23/11/2022)

## Agenda
- Ask about letter of recommendation
- Arrange final pre-deadline meeting for Friday 25th.
- How much detail about chess do I need to go into? Should I explain the ELO system?
	- Alternatively, split some of the current sections on the history of chess into separate subsections, and delve into greater detail on how they worked
	- Turing's Turochamp
	- Prinz's exhaustive chess program
	- IBM's Deep Blue
	- Stockfish and further iterations
	- DeepMind's AlphaZero
- Mark scheme mentions 'comprehensive critical analysis' – how technical do I need to be?
	- Should I delve deep into some of the machine learning methods used in computer chess?
		- For example, talk about how AlphaZero uses a Monte Carlo Tree Search?
- Should I add a Gantt chart to visualise the project plan?
- According to mark scheme, need to add project risks and ethical/legal issues (or a 'convincing justification why there are none') – what things could I talk about?
## Feedback
- Overall focus on breadth, but delve into further detail in specific parts
	- No need for the history of ELO system, but explain what it is, how it works, how it's used to compare the skill sets of players (development section, not background)
	- One or two lines describing how it works
	- Demonstrate the changes between all the computers that played chess
		- Was DeepBlue just faster, or other improvements?
		- e.g. expand one or two sentences from Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm
- No need to go deep into machine learning methods in background
	- However, compare and contrast to show a good understanding of existing solutions
		- Trade-offs
	- Could go deeper into the clustering algorithms in development section?
- Gantt chart could be a good idea
	- Alternatively a bullet point list of where we want to arrive
	- Follow this by the sequence of steps that will get us there
	- May be useful to backtrack from the final deadline – easier to come up with timeline that way
- Project risks and ethical/legal issues
	- Add a subsection for project risks (after design)
	- Add a subsection for ethical/legal issues (after design)
	- Add a subsection for downloading the data (move first paragraph before development, or mini-subsection within development)
	- Project risks
		- Size of the databases
		- Data is already available and consistently being published, so no risk in there
	- No ethical or legal issues in the project
		- Publicly accessible data from Lichess – open-source
		- Not personal data
		- No information about specific chess players – just their username rather than personally identifiable information
		- Output of the project will only concern chess rather than personal habits
		- Output will consist of largely aggregated data to find general trends – no specific info about players
