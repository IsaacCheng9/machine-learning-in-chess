# M11 – Structure of Final Report (26/01/2023)

## Agenda
- Read some of the final report samples from the VLE
	- Could you provide some additional samples from last year's students?
- Managed to log into lab computer and access it remotely via SSH
- Looked into different concurrency methods in Python
	- I/O bound tasks – threading and asyncio
	- CPU-bound tasks – multiprocessing
- Go over final report structure and demonstration – questions on the project plan document.
## To-Do
- Test threading/asyncio/multiprocessing on the data set
	- Record performance analyses – potentially create graphs and store these
		- Potentially mention this step in the report – doesn't have to take long
