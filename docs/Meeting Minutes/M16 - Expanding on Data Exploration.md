# M16 – Expanding on Data Exploration (09/03/2023)

## Progress
- Explained plots about most popular openings and most popular openings by category.
- Created appendices and added examples of openings in it.
- Added sections to README about:
	- Installation – Python version and dependencies
	- External libraries (Scoutfish and pgn-extract) – compiling and using them
	- Reproducing results – performing game metadata analysis
- Calculated popularity of openings and opening categories per rating range.
- Created columns `EloDiff`, `AbsEloDiff`, and `RelativeEloDiff`.
- Started investigating the effect of rating on win rate.
	- Will look into the effect of relative rating on the win rate by comparing the difference from the win rate of White from the overall population.
		- Need to bin the values of relative ratings and take m, the win rate for each bin?

## Questions
- How are my explanations on the plots about most popular openings and most popular openings by category?
	- Explain the difference between open and closed games
	- Add a sentence or two about the difference in distributions between ratings and potential explanations for why
		- Add these graphs in appendices
- Are the appendices implemented correctly?
	- Yes
- Am I lacking any further detail in the README?
	- Level of detail is good
	- Should I include the external libraries in my source code when submitting?
		- Yes
- Do you have any specific suggestions on machine learning directions using the game metadata?
	- SHAP values – feature importance
		- Strength of input values on output
		- How do various features increase the likelihood of a player winning
		- Potential features:
			- RelativeEloDiff
			- Opening
			- Number of games played in sample
				- May be difficult because we’re not using the full population
			- Event
			- Number of moves
			- How does the game end?
				- Need to use Scoutfish for this, or redo pipeline to include number of moves?
	- How does the proportion of frequency of openings vary with ratings?
		- x-axis – rating bins
		- y-axis – popularity of a specific opening when it wins/loses
			- Split colour of the bar to show win/loss rate
		- Use it to create a regression to predict win rate given these scenarios?
			- Game theory
				- Table
				- Decision tree?
			- Nash equilibrium?
	- Investigate variations of the same opening
		- Do variations share the same performance curves as rating changes?
		- Distance metric for similarity
			- Distances between bars in the performance curves
			- Use agglomerative clustering instead of K-means
		- Cluster openings that perform the same
			- Openings that often result in draws vs. wins
			- No train-test split – cluster and then perform clustering validation
				- Silhouette – tightness of clusters
