# M3 – Project Kickoff (07/10/2022)

## Timelines
- First draft of literature review
	- More important to have skeleton of bullet-points for topics by the next meeting
		- Introduction to the topic
		- Previous research
		- Questions and aims of the project
		- Methods we'll be using
			- Preliminary plan – what steps we may take in the project
		- How methods will answer questions
		- Summary
	- Use figures and tables more sparingly
	- Final deadline: 23rd November
- First draft of final report?
	- Extended version of literature review
		- Bulkier section on methods and results
			- e.g. how sample data was selected
		- May not answer all questions, but provide an explanation with a thorough diagnosis
		- Clarity is key
		- Add more figures and tables
	- Final deadline: May 2023

## Housekeeping
- GitHub repository to store minutes, project files, and task planning?
	- Similar to project management in software engineering

## General Advice
- Common mistakes to avoid
	- Scope creep
	- Not explaining 'obvious' things to the reader

## Scale
- Large database files (25GB compressed, 214GB uncompressed for August 2022)
- Ways to work around the size limitations?
	- Download data -> analyse it -> save analysis and delete data
	- External storage drive (portable USB-C SSD)
	- Virtual machine
		- Potential to remote-SSH (2TB of storage)

## Stockfish
- Progress on the Python library

## Starter Topics
- How to select sample data
- Best ways to represent the data
	- pandas dataframe – best for tabular data?
- Exploratory data analysis
	- How many games, how many moves etc.
	- Take the first 1000 games or so to simplify the process
	- Create code pipeline for data analysis
		- Explore big data challenges

## Additional Learning
- See email on content related to Learning From Data and algorithms for machine learning on large datasets
	- How to train a classifier
	- Streaming data / continuous learning
	- Batch processing (sk-learn, river)
	- Parallel processing
