# M6 – Initial Draft of Literature Review (08/11/2022)

## Agenda
- Ask about the specification for the literature review.
	- Do I need to change my sections to align more closely with the specification?
- Ask for advice on initial draft of literature review.
	- Should we change the title to be more specific?
		- 'Machine Learning to Study Chess Games'
	- How well does the introduction flow?
- Enquire about the next meeting – may need to switch it to Tuesday due to travel (9:30am or 3:30pm)?
## Current Progress
- Completed full draft of the introduction.
- Started preliminary research section.
	- Very sparse – need to work on this more.
- Started requirements and design and development subsections.
	- Middling progress – good direction so far.

## Feedback on Literature Review
- Title doesn't have to be a question – may change the wording to read better at a later point if needed.
### Introduction
- Need citations
- Mention that research have been performed on other games like Go – chess isn't the first game to be studied
### Development (Project Management)
- Sequence of things that need to be achieved
	- How are we going to investigate the things we've outlined in the scope?
	- Downloading the data (Lichess database, how we'll be storing the data), filtering the data, analysing the data, making data visualisations etc.
- Name success criteria
	- For example, evaluate results of prediction, evaluate results of clustering
### Evaluation
- How we'll be judging the success of the project
	- See Izzy and Matt for examples
	- Assess the quality of our model – how effective/robust
		- Easier with supervised learning
- Link back to the success criteria
	- Discuss what we need to evaluate – how we'll be evaluating results of prediction/clustering etc.
		- Validation methods, R-squared, etc.
		- Using external data, comparing internal data, etc.
### Conclusion
- Zoom back out and restate the key points of the literature review
- Reiterate why the project is useful and what the intended outcomes are

## Next Steps
- Work on the preliminary research section with more urgency.
- Continue the design and development subsection and start the evaluation subsection.
