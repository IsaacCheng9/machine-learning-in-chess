1.e4 {This game featured a major upset in the U.S. Open. Gabriel Schwartzman is a
very talented young Grandmaster but he runs into a creative sacrifice in this game.}
e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 {
The old Steinitz variation is enjoying renewed popularity these days. A game
between Kasparov and Short at the 1994 Euwe Memorial in Amsterdam had made a
deep impression on me, and I was hoping to make use of a plan involving h4,
Rh3-g3 and a kingside attack that worked well for Kasparov.}
Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 Qb6 8.Qd2 {
The pawn sacrifice offered by this move has rarely been tested in the
tournament arena. I was quite surprised when Schwartzman accepted it.}
Qxb2 9.Rb1 Qa3 10.dxc5 {
This was my own idea. 10.Be2 was recommended in an old book by Harding, but it
did not impress me at all. I decided to eliminate the dark-squared bishops and
use Kasparov's attacking formation on the kingside.} Bxc5 11.Bxc5
Qxc5 12.Bd3 a6 13.h4 Nb6 {13...Qe7 would have made it harder for me to justify the investment of the pawn.}
14.Rh3 $1 Nc4 15.Bxc4 Qxc4 16.a3 $1 {This is a very important move. I need to free the knight from the need to hang around at c3 just to defend the poor pawn.}
b5 17.Ne2 Bd7 18.Nfd4 $1 {
This eliminates the enemy knight, and I have a decent endgame even without the
pawn, because Black is left with a very bad bishop.} Nxd4 19.Nxd4
Rc8 20.Rbb3 $1 {
There are two points to this move. One is to be ready to transfer to the
kingside at a moment's notice, and the other, more subtle, will be revealed shortly.}
O-O 21.Rhg3 f6 { Standard French counterply.} 22.f5 {!?} {
I hadn't worked out all the tactics here. But I had a great deal of confidence
and had seen some pleasant long variations, beginning at move 27!}

1.e4 {As I was finishing this book I took part in one of the regular all-Master
training tournaments held monthly in the San Francisco area. I found myself
paired with a very strong opponent, Mike Arne (2400 FIDE). Since we were due to
meet a few weeks later in an IM norm tournament, I decided that I shouldn't
play my special preparation for him.  Naturally with so much Spielmann on my
mind I turned to one of his favorite lines, the Worral Attack in the Spanish
Game. My preparation consisted solely of annotating a few games for this book,
and the choice was made at the board.  So this game shows that it is not
necessary to study a lot of opening theory as White in the Spanish Game. All
that is needed is some basic concepts, and either courage or recklessness!}

 This is probably not necessary, as Black's bishop is headed to b7, but I
wanted to make sure it was kept off of g4, where the pin on the knight would weaken my control of d4.}

and felt that a pawn could safely be invested for good attacking chances.}
