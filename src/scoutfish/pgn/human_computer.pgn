1. Nf3
 {Garry decided to play this much more passive move compared
 to 1.e4 or 1.d4, in an attempt to keep the game quiet, with as
 few tactical strikes as possible. As everybody knows, the
 computer's main strength lies in calculating concrete lines
 very fast and very far, and not necessarily in the area of
 positional play, so it is normal for Garry to try to steer the
 game in this direction.}
1...d5
 { Black's response indicates no desire to copy white's actions.}
2. g3
 {fianchetto}
2...Bg4
 {Black's idea is to counteract the power of the white bishop,
 by building a pawn fortress on the squares c6, d5, and e6. But
 before doing that, he makes sure that the his bishop isn't
 caught inside}
3. b3
 {One of the most memorable games in Kasparov's career was the last
 game of his 1987 world championship match against Anatoly
 Karpov. Despite the fact the he needed a win to preserve his
 title, he chose the rather passive double fianchetto}
3...Nd7
 {The computer passes on an attractive opportunity to double
 white's pawns on the 'f' file, by taking the knight on f3.
 This only means that in Deep Blue's eyes, keeping the pair of
 bishops is more important than ruining the opponent's pawn
 structure. In this case, the machine's decision was correct.}
4. Bb2 e6 5. Bg2 Ngf6 6. O-O c6 7. d3 Bd6 8. Nbd2 O-O
9. h3 Bh5 10. e3
 {Kasparov once again proves he doesn't want a violent
 confrontation, by playing e3, instead of
 e4}
10...h6 11. Qe1 Qa5? 12. a3 Bc7? 13. Nh4!
 {Black's hesitation in the last moves allows white to grab the
 initiative. Nh4 is also a way of proving that black's
 overprotective h7-h6 a few moves back was no such a good idea.
 Now white threatens to push g3-g4, and send the bishop to g6,
 where the knight can't wait to capture it. The advantage of
 trading under these conditions is that white gets the pair of
 bishops and at the same time ruins black's pawn structure.}
13...g5!? 14. Nhf3 e5!
 {If black doesn't want to lose this game quickly, he has to
 close the position. The push of the 'g' pawn created a very
 weak a1-h8 diagonal, which black has to cover in some way.
 e6-e5 is not without problems, as we'll see in a second, but
 Deep Blue has no other choice - the bishop on b2 is too
 powerful and its line of fire comes a little too close to the
 black king.}
15. e4 Rfe8
 {One of the effects of black's last two moves is the complete weakening of the f5
 square. }
16. Nh2! Qb6
 {Deep Blue discovered that one of the steps in white's march to
 f5 is the removal of the rook on f1. This means that the pawn
 on f2 suddenly loses its most defenders, so the machine, like
 a bloodhound, started the hunt. First by placing the queen on
 b6, and then by adding the bishop to the diagonal. }
17. Qc1 a5 18. Re1 Bd6 19. Ndf1 dxe4 20. dxe4 Bc5 21. Ne3
Rad8 22. Nhf1
 {Both sides have achieved their ideal positions. Black's pieces
 are placed almost perfectly, but he still has the weak f5
 square. White meanwhile is a little behind in development, but
 the same f5 square compensates for it plentifully. The only
 thing he does need to solve is the 'f2' problem. It is hard to
 play Nf5 while the black bishop and queen are enjoying such an
 impressive supremacy on the g1-a7 diagonal, but no one can
 stop white from slowly preparing b3-b4, for instance, and
 chasing the black bishop away, thus getting ready for the
 heralded arrival of the knight to f5.}
22...g4?
 {The fatal error.....Kasparov will say after the match that "pawns had to stay back to 
 defend the king". He smiled after this move.}
23. hxg4 Nxg4 24. f3 Nxe3 25. Nxe3 Be7! 26. Kh1!
 {this will ensure that in the
 concrete variations that can ensue in such a dynamic position,
 there is no check that ruins everything}
26...Bg5 27. Re2 a4 28. b4 f5!?
 {Deep Blue finds another way of throwing the
 position in the air}
29. exf5 e4 30. f4!
 {This move obviously sacrifices an exchange, but it does two
 very significant things: it keeps the 'e' file tightly closed,
 thus making the black extra rook sit as a spectator for a
 while, and it gets rid of the black bishop. Add to this the
 might of the white pawns on the kings side, and you realized
 that white might have given up material, but also got a lot in
 return.}
30...Bxe2
 {One interesting
 variation was 30...Bf4 31.gf4 Be2, but as Kasparov pointed out in
 his short talk with the audience after the game, the opening
 of the 'g' file is to white's advantage, because it allows a
 quick transferal to the king side of the heavy artillery from
 the queen side with 32.Qg1. }
31. fxg5 Ne5 32. g6 Bf3!
 {Black finds a beautiful spot for the bishop}
33. Bc3 Qb5 34. Qf1!
 {after Qb5, black threatens to come
 in, which white can ill afford. So better trade queens and get
 out of danger, hoping that the 'f' and 'g' pawns are enough to
 win}
34...Qxf1+ 35. Rxf1 h5 36. Kg1!
 {Kasparov’s decision not to take on e5
 and f3 was correct, as his post game analysis proved. After
 36.Bf3 ef3 37.Be5 Re5 38.Rf3 Kg7!, black gets a powerful
 blockade of the pawns, which could make things difficult for
 white. }
36...Kf8 37. Bh3! b5 38. Kf2 Kg7 39. g4! Kh6 40. Rg1 hxg4
41. Bxg4 Bxg4 42. Nxg4+ Nxg4+ 43. Rxg4 Rd5 44. f6 Rd1?!

1. e4 e5
 {It is not a
 secret that Kasparov’s favorite move here is 1...c5, leading to
 the Sicilian Defense. But, since this defense can lead to
 rather sharp positions, which Black wants to avoid, he chooses
 to play 1...e5 instead. This is a very solid move, which
 usually leads to complex positions, and thus seems a perfect
 choice for this match.}
2. Nf3 Nc6
 {This time Kasparov goes for the straight forward way of defending
 the 'e5' pawn, even though he actually won the game with the
 Petroff last year. Deep Blue team didn't waste the past year -
 they prepared very hard, and one of their priorities must have
 been improving the lines played in the last match. So, better
 avoid them completely...}
3. Bb5
 {The choice of
 openings is a little surprising. The Ruy Lopez is well known
 for its closed positions and extreme complexity. }

 {Open Variation}
6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 O-O 9. h3 h6 10. d4 Re8
11. Nbd2
 {This doesn't seem to be a great place for the white knight,
 but it really doesn't matter, because the knight is en route
 to much bigger things. Deep Blue intends to send it to f1, g3,
 and then hopefully its final destination, f5. From there, it
 can put pressure on the black king, and create some serious
 discomfort in the black bunker.}
11...Bf8 12. Nf1 Bd7 13. Ng3 Na5 14. Bc2 c5 15. b3 Nc6
16. d5 Ne7 17. Be3 Ng6 18. Qd2 Nh7!?
 {Kasparov finally gets off the well trodden path of chess theory
 with this interesting move. It seems as if black has decided
 to start an offensive on the king side, now that the center is
 finally blocked. By playing Nh7, black opens the d8-h4
 diagonal, with the declared intention of bringing his queen
 into the action.}
19. a4!
 { This move at once
 shows black that his rook will have to remain for a while on
 a8, since now white has at any point the option of capturing
 on b5 and opening the 'a' file.}
19...Nh4 20. Nxh4 Qxh4 21. Qe2!
 {A beautiful and very subtle move by Deep Blue, showing an
 amazing understanding of the position on the computer's
 behalf. The queen comes to e2 for two diametrically opposed
 purposes: first of all, it is a defensive move. Now that the
 control of the 'f4' square is not so important, the queen
 moves over to the d1-h5 diagonal, thus preempting any tactical
 strikes that could have followed after the black knight's jump
 to g5. At the same time, the queen on e2 is putting additional pressure 
 	on the b5 pawn, and
 threatening to continue adding to it with Bc2-d3.}
21...Qd8?!
 {a very dubious decision to abandon any possible
 initiative opportunities on the king side, and instead focus
 on the defense on the queen side}
22. b4! Qc7 23. Rec1
 {Now white threatens to blow up the entire queen side with the
 c3-c4 push}
23...c4 24. Ra3
 {Deep Blue's next plan is simple: double the rooks, and then
 take the pawn on b5. }
24...Rec8 25. Rca1 Qd8 26. f4!!
 {The idea of opening a second front is fantastic, because it is
 white's pieces that have greater mobility, and thus can go
 from one side to another much easier than black's. Black,
 meanwhile, has to suddenly fight disadvantageous situations on
 both sides of the chess board, and he hardly has the resources
 to do so.}
26...Nf6 27. fxe5!?
 {Deep Blue plays a very interesting move. Instead of making
 sure that the black bishop on f8 never sees the daylight
 again, he actually opens the a3-f8 diagonal for it. The
 reason a passed pawn on the 'd' file. }
27...dxe5 28. Qf1?! Ne8
 {The black knight is continuing its trip to the queen side,
 where it very needed}
29. Qf2! Nd6 30. Bb6 Qe8 31. R3a2 Be7 32. Bc5!
 {The machine immediately senses that black is trying to
 activate his bishop, so he cuts off this idea by attacking the
 knight on d6, and making sure black has to keep the bishop
 there to defend it.}
32...Bf8 33. Nf5! Bxf5 34. exf5 f6 35. Bxd6!
 {as long as the knight sits on d6, winning is
 impossible}
35...Bxd6 36. axb5 axb5 37. Be4!
 {This is much better than 37.Qb6. First of all, the bishop blocks
 the 'e' pawn, thus making sure, for the n-th time this game,
 that black will get absolutely no counter play. At the same
 time, it improves the position of the bishop, and also creates
 threats based on the movement of the 'd' pawn, in case black's
 bishop is thinking about taking a trip. Finally, by opening
 the 2nd rank, it ensures that the queen will get into the
 black camp no matter what, whether through b6, or on the 'a'
 file.}
37...Rxa2 38. Qxa2 Qd7 39. Qa7 Rc7 40. Qb6 Rb7 41. Ra8+
Kf7?
 {41...Kh7 would have been a
 better choice}
42. Qa6 Qc7 43. Qc6
 {White is once again offering a queen trade, this time in even
 better conditions. If black accepts it, he will suddenly find
 himself fighting against a pawn on c6, and an even more active
 white bishop. Because of the position of the black king, Qc6
 also has a more concrete threat: Qe8 mate!}
43...Qb6+ 44. Kf1 Rb8 45. Ra6!
 {The computer doesn't succumb to the temptation of Qd7 followed
 by Ra7, because after 45.Qd7 Kg8 46. Ra7 Bf8 47.d6 Qe3, black
 manages to prevent the checkmate by creating his own perpetual
 check chance.
 Instead, Deep Blue plays the powerful Ra6, which forces black
 to trade queens, and thus practically end the game, since
 after 45...Qc6 46.dc6 black has no way of stopping the 'c'
 pawn and at the same time preventing white from capturing too
 many pawns. Which is why the world champion resigned.
 However, the world champion resigned
 too early. In this position, he could have still achieved a
 draw with 45...Qe3!!. }

1. d3
 {This move
 is never seen at Grandmaster level, for the simple reason that
 it hands over the advantage of the first move to Black.}
1...e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c4 Nf6 4. a3
 {This is a standard position from the Sicilian Defense, but
 with colors reversed and a tempo down, and that is enough to
 confuse Deep Blue. There are simply too many options to
 consider in the opening, even with its enormous calculating
 power.}
4...d6 5. Nc3 Be7 6. g3 O-O 7. Bg2
 {Activating the bishop on the long diagonal, and building a
 solid home for White's king.}
7...Be6 8. O-O Qd7
 {I think most humans would be worried
 about a knight arriving at g5 and would play 8...h6 first.}
9. Ng5
 {The knight move complicates the position, so it's no wonder
 that the world champion thought for over twenty minutes before
 going down this path. Black must preserve the bishop with
 either 9...Bg4 or...}
9...Bf5 10. e4 Bg4 11. f3 Bh5 12. Nh3
 {Having sidelined the bishop Kasparov retreats his knight
 preparing to storm his pawns down the board on the kingside.
 His strategy here bears some similarity to the Kings Indian
 Defense - with colors reversed - in which Kasparov is a great
 expert.}
12...Nd4 13. Nf2 h6
 {A cautious, but probably wise, decision giving the bishop an
 escape square in case Kasparov does attempt a pawn storm.}
14. Be3 c5 15. b4 b6 16. Rb1 Kh8
 {It's hard to say what this move is about. It might be that
 Deep Blue envisages a time when the position will open up, in
 which case the king is best placed tucked away in the corner.}
17. Rb2!
 {After the game, Kasparov
 demonstrated the following variation: 17.h4 a6 18.Bxd4 cxd4
 19.Bh3 Qc7 20.Nd5 Nxd5 21.cxd5 . The point of h4 was to keep
 Black's bishop from moving to g5 from where it controls c1 and
 can settle on e3. But now White is set to dominate the c-file
 as the bishop on h3 controls c8. }
17...a6 18. bxc5 bxc5 19. Bh3 Qc7 20. Bg4 Bg6 21. f4
 {White's strategy is directed against the bishop on g6: he
 wants to bury it by playing the pawn to f5.}
21...exf4 22. gxf4!
 {Kasparov has a powerful pawn center; he has a knight which
 is itching to leap into d5 once Black's knight can be shifted
 from f6; and Black's bishops have no scope at all. A human
 with this position against Kasparov would feel completely
 demoralized.}
22...Qa5
 {Deep Blue abandons its fight for squares and
 grabs a pawn instead.}

27. Nh3 Rfb8 28. Nf4 Bd8 29. Nfd5 Nc6 30. Bf4 Ne5 31. Ba4
Nxd5 32. Nxd5 a5?
 {a poor positional decision by Deep Blue}
33. Bb5 Ra7 34. Kg2 g5 35. Bxe5+ dxe5 36. f6!
 {This is the crucial move. Black's position is cut in two.
 There is little connection between kingside and queenside
 which is potentially extremely dangerous for Black's king.
 Although Kasparov is a pawn down his superbly placed knight
 and bishop almost single-handedly dominate Black's pieces
 (with a bit of help from the pawn on f6).}
36...Bg6 37. h4 gxh4 38. Kh3 Kg8 39. Kxh4 Kh7 40. Kg4 Bc7!
 {Deep Blue is prepared
 to give back a pawn to free his position }
41. Nxc7 Rxc7 42. Rxa5 Rd8 43. Rf3 Kh8 44. Kh4 Kg8
45. Ra3 Kh8 46. Ra6 Kh7
 {This prevents the positional threat 47. Bc6 Rd6, and White
 can't escape the pin as there is no rook check on a8.}

 {Kasparov will say that 34...Nxd4 35.exd4 Ne6 was his original

 attacked, the two kingside pawns are vulnerable...but then
 comes the shock: 36.Nxd5+ cxd5 37.Rc3+ with a vicious

 {This move is based on the fact that Black's knights work best

 trapped on g6. Black threatens ...Ng4 and ...Ne5. White can
 try 37 Bd5 Ng4 38 Re6 Rxe6 39 Bxe6, but 39...Ne3 leaves him
 struggling.}
35. Bd5 Nd6 36. Re6 Nb5!

 the game continuation, there is not a great deal to be done
 about it. For instance 37 Kb2 can be met by 37...Nd3+ with
 some really juicy forks on the cards.}

 {Though I couldn't quite see how Deep Blue was going to hold
 the game, from the way in which Kasparov had seemingly lost
 interest, I had a feeling that something was up. He was
 curiously pensive, leaning back in his chair and staring away
 from the board somewhere into the middle distance. He didn't
 look like a man about to make a new queen.}

 time to force a draw by perpetual check.}

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5
 { This time we have a Caro-Kann proper}
3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7
 {This line is actually the favorite of Anatoly Karpov. In fact the two have done battle
 from this exact position - but with Kasparov on the white
 side. }

 knight immediately with 5...h6, then White
 has 6 Ne6! fxe6 7

7. N1f3 h6?
 {The fatal error....he should have played
 7...Bd6, which leads to standard and frequently played

O-O 8. Ne2 c5 9. O-O Nc6 10. Be3 Bg4 11. f3 Bd7 { An unusual variation. 
More usual is 11 ... Na5. Rebel's following move was still in its book. 
} 12. Rb1 Qc7 { Rebel's book expected 12 ... Na5. Now the chessprogram 
had to think for the very first time. } 13. Nf4 { Also after a longer think 
Rebel sticks to this logical move. White tries to take advantage of the 
unusual c7-square for the Black queen by means of Nf4-d5. } 13... e6 14. 
Be2 { A serious alternative would have been 14. d5. Rebel's move removes 
the bishop to Nc6-a5 attacks. } 14... Ne7 { Preventing 15 d5, but the knight 
is very passive at e7. More active was 14 ... Rad8 or Rfd8. } 15. Qb3 b6 
{ Already the losing mistake! Much stronger was either 15 ... Rab8, or 
Rebel's choice 15 ... b5!? } 16. dxc5 bxc5 17. Qa3 { Very strong. c5 is 
a big weakness. Note that the undefended knight on e7 prevents the answer 
... c5-c4. } 17... Be5 { Played after prolonged thought. It is the only 
way to defend c5. } 18. g3 Bd6 19. Rfd1 { Simply threatening 20 Rxd6. There 
is not much Black can do about that. } 19... Rfb8 { Trying to get some 
active counterplay. 19 ... Rac8 or Rfc8 would allow 20 Ba6, or even 20 
Rb1-b2-d2 with huge pressure and winning material. } 20. Rxb8+ Rxb8 21.

6. b3 { Rebel out of book. } 6... c5 7. Bb2 Ne4 8. c3 { Again passively 
played! } 8... Nc6 9. e3 Bg4 { I would prefer 9 ... b6, to get the bishop 
to a6 or b7. } 10. h3 cxd4 { A little trick: If 11 hxg4, then 11 ... dxc3 
and if the bishop moves, 12 ... c2 will follow. } 11. cxd4 Bf5 12. Nfd2 
{ Anand continues to play passively. More logical was 12 Nh4 and then 13 
Nd2 to get rid of the e4-knight. } 12... Nf6 { Preventing piece exchanges. 
} 13. Nc3 { Now the black c6-knights enters the White position. It was 
possible to play 13 a3 to prevent this. } 13... Nb4 14. Nf3 Nd3 { A so 
called 'octopus'. It appears that it is very difficult to get rid of this 
awsome knight. } 15. Ba3 Rc8 16. Ne2 Be4 17. Nh2 { This is too passive. 
Rebel expected the stronger 17 Ng5. Also 17 Nc1 to remove Nd3 was better. 
Perhaps Anand hoped to take advantage of the loose Black pieces. } 17... 
Bh6 18. Qd2 Re8 { Even after a longer thought Rebel prefers this somewhat 
srange move. More natural would be 18 ... Qd7, or 18 ... b5. } 19. Ng4 
{ This is a clear mistake! After 19 f3! Rc2! 20 Qxc2 Bxe3+ 21 Rf2! the 
game would end in perpetual check (try it out yourself!). Now Black is 
better. } 19... Nxg4 20. hxg4 Qc7 { Taking the c-file. } 21. Rfd1 { This 
was the last chance for Nc1. } 21... Qc2 22. Kf1 Qxd2 23. Rxd2 b5 { Keeping 
the pressure and preparing a brilliant piece sacrifice. } 24. f3 Bxe3 25. 
Rdd1 f5 { Fantastic! Vishy looked very surprised and nervous. Black opens 
the f-file to attack the poor white king. } 26. fxe4 fxe4 27. Rxd3 { It 
is understandable that Anand wants to get rid of the huge knight on d3, 
but after the game we found out that 27 Nf4 was the only chance to fight. 
Now it is all over. } 27... exd3 28. Nf4 Rc2 29. Bxd5+ e6 { And there is 
no defence: 30 Bxe6+ Rxe6 31 Nxe6 Rf2+ 32 Ke1 d2+ 33 Kd1 Rf1+ followed 
by 34 ... Rxa1 and 35 ... d1Q. So Anand resigned. 0-1 } 0-1

1. d4 d6 { Surprise, I've never seen Vishy playing this before. } 2. e4 
g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. f4 { IMO this agressive continuation is best for a chess 
program. } 4... c6 5. Nf3 Bg4 6. Be3 Nd7 { More usual is 6 ... Qb6. } 7. 
h3 Bxf3 8. Qxf3 e6 9. O-O-O d5 { Rebel had 9 ... Ne7 in its book. } 10. 
g4 { Rebel was debating between this and 10 f5!? After a longer think Rebel 
would have preferred 10 f5!?, which is an interesting continuation. But 
also 10 g4 is perfectly playable, of course. } 10... Ne7 11. h4 { Impressive, 
these white pawns! } 11... b5 { Preparing a counterattack on the queen's 
side. Rebel expected 11 ... h5. } 12. h5 b4 13. h6 { This isn't good. White 
should open the king's side, not close it. The normal move was 13 Ne2, 
with an interesting fight coming up. } 13... Bf8 14. Ne2 dxe4 15. Qxe4 
Nd5 { A strong position for the black knight. The white attack has come 
to a standstill. } 16. Bg2 Be7 17. Bd2 O-O 18. Qd3 { White should try a 
plan involving f4-f5, but it is clear that the white pawn on h6 prevents 
a huge attack. It might even be better if this pawn was off the board. 
} 18... N7f6 19. g5 { Now Black is clearly better. Rebel abandons the f5-square 
and has no counterplay at all. } 19... Ne8 20. Ng3 a5 21. Rde1 Nd6 { Simple 
chess by Anand. The other knight goes to f5. White has no play and Black 
can attack with a5-a4. } 22. Qe2 Re8 23. Rhf1 Bf8 24. Ne4 Nf5 25. Qd3 Qb6 
26. c3 { The losing move. White opens up the b-file, black only needs to 
say 'thank you'! Of course White's only chance was to keep the position 
as closed as possible. My guess would be 26 Kb1 and hope for the best. 
} 26... bxc3 27. Bxc3 Red8 28. Bh3 Be7 { Rebel prefers 28 ... Qb5, as 29 
Qxb5 cxb5 would lose material. } 29. Bxf5 { To get rid of the pressure 
on d4, but now the white squares are gone (especially e4). } 29... exf5 
30. Nd2 Qc7 { Winning the pawn on f4. Black is winning. } 31. Rg1 Bd6 32. 
Kb1 Bxf4 { 32 ... Nxf4 was possible as well. } 33. Nc4 a4 { A variation 
by Rebel: 33 ... c5!? 34 dxc5 Qxc5 35 Qd4 Qxd4 36 Bxd4 and Black has the 
advantage. } 34. Bd2 Re8 { Again 34 ... c5 looks a serious continuation. 
} 35. Rxe8+ Rxe8 36. Qc2 Bxd2 37. Qxd2 Re4 { Rebel thinks this move is 
a mistake, costing Black the largest part of his advantage. The computer 
prefers 37 ... Qf4 instead. } 38. Rc1 { With the simple idea of 39 Ne5, 
attacking the c6-pawn. } 38... Ne7 { After 10 minutes Rebel would have 
played 38 ... Re6, only scoring +0.28 for Black. } 39. Qc3 { Contains the 
strong threat 40 d5! } 39... Nd5 40. Qd2 Re6 41. Ne5 Qb6 { 41. ... f6!? 
is interesting. } 42. Rc4 Qb5 { A strong move, activating the queen and 
threatening 43 ... Rxe5. } 43. Rc5 Qf1+ 44. Qc1 Qxc1+ 45. Kxc1 f6 { Of 
course. Black gets two connected passed pawns: g6 and f5. White gets his 
pawn back, but I am sure Black still is better in this ending. } 46. gxf6 
Nxf6 47. Ra5 { The a-pawn is more important than the c6-pawn. White tries 
to get a passed a-pawn, trying to compensate for the g6 and f5 pawns. } 
47... Kf8 { To activate the king. After 10 minutes on my Pentium MMX 200 
MHz Rebel plays 47 ... Ne8 as Black. As tempi are very important in this 
ending, 47 ... g5 merits consideration. } 48. Ra8+ { A strong check. The 
black king is worse on e7, compared to the better square f8. } 48... Ke7 
49. Rxa4 Rd6 { Again losing time, but it appears that the ending is not 
so clear anymore. White has gained a lot of counterplay. Probably 47 ... 
Kf8 is the cause of this. } 50. Rc4 g5 { Finally, although Rebel prefers 
50 ... Ke6 to activate the king. } 51. a4 g4 52. a5 g3 { This looks like 
a mistake, because it is now easy for White to stop the Black pawns by 
putting a knight on f3. } 53. Rc3 { 53 a6 could be played. } 53... f4 54. 
a6 g2 55. Nf3 Nd5 56. a7 Nc7 57. Rb3 { Now White is compeletely winning. 
} 57... Rd8 58. Rb8 Kd7 59. Kd1 { The a7-pawn is keeping all Black's pieces 
busy. In the meantime Rebel simply plans Kd1-e2-f2xg2 and Ng5, winning 
pawn h7. It's all over! } 59... Na8 60. Ke2 Kc7 61. Rxd8 Kxd8 62. Kf2 {

} 13. Be2 Re8 14. h4 { To push the pawn to h5, after which exd4 becomes 
a threat (the Black knight cannot go to g6 anymore). } 14... c5 { Starting 
the counterattack and defending the pawn on d4. } 15. f4 Nd7 16. Bf3 { 
Supporting the advance e3-e4. White's plan is to get the pawns e4, f4 and 
d5 rolling. Black attacks on the queen's side. } 16... b5 { There we go. 
I began to like the Black position more and more. I guess Vishy wanted 
to have a much more quiet game today! } 17. Qd3 Qf6 { A nice place for 
the queen, also stopping the advance e3-e4 because of the pressure on f4. 
} 18. Bc1 dxe3 19. fxe3 c4 20. Qc2 Nc5 21. h5 Nd3 { For the second time 
this match Rebel gets an octopus on d3. See also game 2. } 22. Rxd3 { Rebel 
didn't expect this exchange sac, but I was sure Anand would play this. 
It almost came without thinking. In return White gets two bishops and a 
pawn. For a moment Black's attack is gone and he has to concentrate on 
the White pawnroller in the centre. } 22... cxd3 23. Qxd3 Rec8 { Well played. 
Rebel finds a way to bring new life into the Black attack. } 24. Bd2 b4 
{ Keeping the bishop away from c3. } 25. Be4 Qh6 { The only good move. 
25 ... h6 was my first impression, but then 26 Bf5  rook moves 27 e4 comes 
and the pawns go forward. White is better in that case. } 26. Bg2 { Criticised 
by Anand after the match. He underestimated Black's 27th. On the other 
hand it is difficult for White to find a proper plan. His pawns are still 
not able to move. } 26... Rc7 27. Rf1 b3 { Here it is. Now Anand was visibly 
getting nervous, as Black's attack suddenly is very strong. The natural 
28 a3 would allow the black rook to come to c2, and also sacrifices like 
Bxa3 are hanging in the air. } 28. e4 { There is no way back! Now we get 
a very, very interesting game. } 28... bxa2+ 29. Ka1 { Of course any computer 
would play 29 Kxa2 here, which is very bad. The White king uses the black 
a2-pawn as a shelter. After Kxa2 the a-file would be wide open to the black 
attack. } 29... Rcb7 30. Bc1 Bc5 { A crushing move. The idea is ... Rb3, 
... Qb6 and ... Bd4 and White is going to get crushed on b2. Rebel's evaluation 
now showed a big advantage to Black. } 31. e5 { Trying to shut the door 
to b6 by means of d5-d6. } 31... Rb3 32. Qc2 Bd4 { If 32 ... Qb6, then 
White has the defence 33 d6 Bd4 34 d7! } 33. d6 Bxb2+ { Too early! After 
the game we found out that Rebel could have won with the brilliant 33 ... 
Qe6! 34 Bc6 Rc3!! 35 bxc3 Qc4! On my Pentium 200 Mhz MMX Rebel 9 needs 
around 11 minutes to find this move. } 34. Bxb2 Rxb2 35. Qxb2 Rxb2 36. 
Kxb2 g5 { A very surprising move, but Rebel saw that after the normal 36 
... Qxh5 White has 37 Rc1, with back rank problems. Analysis after the 
game confirmed that there is no win for Black. } 37. Bf3 { Well played. 
Anand finds the line that secures a draw. } 37... gxf4 38. Rd1 Qe6 39. 
d7 { The point. Anand's passed d7-pawn is a monster, killing all Black's 
hopes. } 39... Qxe5+ 40. Kxa2 Qa5+ { As I saw absolutely no way to make 
progress (Anand looked convinced, too), I offered a draw. Anand accepted 
and said after the last game the position is drawn. A very exciting game, 
one to be very proud of. Rebel played great chess IMO.  1/2-1/2 } 1/2-1/2

1. d4 { A difficult choice. From a computer's point of view 1 e4 is the 
most likely choice to be played, but I like surprises and I had something 
in mind. } 1... Nf6 2. c4 e6 { Whoops, didn't count on that one. In the 
specially prepared openingbook I counted on the Grunfeld, the Queen's Gambit 
Accepted and the Slav. Also the Queen's Indian was prepared, but less thoroughly 
than the other openings. } 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 { During the game I wished I 
had chosen 4 g3 instead. But 4 a3 is not bad at all, leading to a lively 
game. The move is still popular and 4 g3 leads to a much more quiet game. 
} 4... Bb7 5. Nc3 d5 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Qc2 Nxc3 8. bxc3 Nd7 9. e4 c5 10. 
Bf4 Qc8 { Out of book. Rebel only knows 10 ... Be7 and 10 ... cxd4. I must 
confess that I thought that 10 ... Qc8 was a novelty, because I had never 
seen it before. } 11. Bb5 { Heavily criticised, because the bookmove 11 
d5 scored a clear 3-0 for White recently. But this is nonsense IMO: A great 
player like Anand would NEVER play 10 ... Qc8 if this can be refuted by 
11 d5. Anand confirmed after the game that Rebel's move 11 Bb5 is a good 
one. } 11... a6 12. Bxd7+ Qxd7 13. Ne5 Qc8 { Rebel expected 13 ... Qd8 
14 Rd1. } 14. Qd3 { An interesting move. First Rebel wanted to play 14 
Nc4, but the reply 14 ... Qc6 is sufficient in that case. } 14... b5 { 
Stops 15 Nc4, but overlooks White's next move. Maybe it was better to complete 
development first. } 15. Qf3 { Very surprising! The main idea is 15 ... 
Be7? 16 Bg5! It is very difficult to find a good move for Black here. } 
15... Bd6 { A brilliant solution. Anand gives some material to reach an 
unclear ending. Other moves have been analysed, but all seem insufficient. 
All in all anand used about 20 minutes to come to this decision. Again 
no quiet game! } 16. Nxf7 { Immediately indicating an evaluation of +2, 
but this is far too optimistic! } 16... Bxf4 17. Nxh8 Qc7 18. Qh5+ { Less 
good is 18 g3 Bh6! Black plans 19 ... 0-0-0 20 Nf7 Rf8. } 18... g6 19. 
Nxg6 hxg6 20. Qxg6+ Qf7 21. Qxf7+ Kxf7 { So White has rook + 3 pawns for 
2 bishops. But one pawn will fall (d4 is weak) and it is not easy to get 
the pawns on the king's side going. According to Anand the ending is unclear. 
Most chess programs, though, still think White is clearly better. } 22. 
g3 { Rebel was debating between this move and 22 f3. After 22 g3 the move 
22 ... Bxe4?? fails to 23 f3 Bxf3 24 Rf1 winning a piece. } 22... Bh6 23. 
f3 cxd4 24. cxd4 Rc8 { Taking control of the c-file. Because of the weaknesses 
on d4 and a3, Black is always able to win back one pawn. } 25. h4 { This 
is a clear mistake. Anand indicated after the game that 25 Ke2 should be 
played, with a very unclear endgame. } 25... Rc2 { This rook is seriously 
hampering White's game. } 26. g4 Be3 27. h5 Kg7 { Stopping the pawns. Note 
how useless the White king's side pawns are. } 28. Rd1 a5 { Planning b5-b4 
creating a strong passed pawn. White has to activate the h1-rook quickly, 
or else it is over. } 29. d5 exd5 30. Rh3 { Not a nice move, but it contains 
a little trick. Rebel first wanted to play the normal 30 exd5, but then 
30 ... b4, or first 30 ... Ba6 followed by 31 ... b4 would have been decisive. 
} 30... b4 31. axb4 axb4 32. f4 { Here it is. White finally activates his 
unfortunate rook. The tactical point is 32 ... d4?? 33 Rxe3 dxe3 34 Rd7+. 
} 32... Bf2+ 33. Kf1 Bc5 { The cleanest way. } 34. Ke1 d4 { Creating a 
second passed pawn. Because the White pawns cannot accomplish anything, 
the game is over. } 35. e5 Rc3 { Securing the further advance of the pawns. 
} 36. Rh2 b3 37. h6+ Kh7 { Here I resigned the game before Rebel could

{Matches of the best human players against computer programs are very common
nowadays as the question of human or computer superiority in chess is still
open and more than ever. Last year Kramnik drew 4:4 against Fritz in Bahrein

this year. Can one side change this now? In the first game Kasparov had
good chances, but could not use them in slight time trouble. But see for
yourself} 1. Nf3 {Does Kasparov play like this to
avoid the Tarrasch variation of the Queen's Gambit or is this the best move

both players. X3D Fritz has almost three million positions in its library of
opening moves and sequences. Kasparov is legendary for his opening preparation

opponents have a healthy fear of his surprises in the openings. This move
also takes the game away from the game Kasparov won against Deep Junior in
this line. That's a sort of psychological advantage, being the first to spring
something unexpected. Between two humans it could also be sort of like a game
of chicken, with the first player to turn off from the previous game being the
chicken. No matter how well it plays chess, this aspect is lost on X3D Fritz.

1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 c6 5. e3 a6 {Diverging from game one, when
the more common 5...Nbd7 was played. This sideline of the Slav with 5...a6 was
criticized by Kasparov after the game. From the continuation here we can see
why. X3D Fritz is playing from its opening book right into a position it
doesn't understand at all! When Kasparov said this everyone looked over at
poor Alex Kure, the man responsible for selecting and "training" X3D Fritz's
openings. Kasparov has little practical experience with this sideline and in
both cases (once with white and once with black) the game continued with 6.b3.
 When this move appeared on the screen I thought maybe the Fritz team were
trying to give Kasparov a little psychological jab. He played this move
himself a month ago against Huzman in a game that turned into the shortest
loss of his career after a horrific blunder. They wouldn't admit it, but you
know they knew about that game and that Kasparov would be forced to think
about while he was sitting there against X3D Fritz.} 6. c5 Nbd7 7. b4 a5 8. b5

Nd2 Be7 {All of these moves had been played before, although Kasparov said
afterwards that he was not conscious of that at the time at this point. The
game they are following was not a minor one, but a battle from the world
championship match-tournament in 1948 between American Samuel Reshevsky and
Soviet (Estonian) Paul Keres.} 12. b6 {Immediately sealing the queenside and
diverging from that game from 1948, although there are still many similarities.
A player as strong as Keres had no difficulty in seeing that Black needs
immediate pawn play on the kingside in order to compensate for White's
advantage on the kingside. He played a rapid ...h5 push and entered a very
sharp battle.} (12. Be2 h5 13. b6 Qd8 14. h3 Nf8 15. O-O-O Ne6 16. Ndxe4 Nxe4 (

is betting that X3D Fritz won't know what to do in this position without any
clear targets for its pieces. All the time Kasparov spent training with X3D
Fritz clearly paid off. 13.h3 doesn't develop anything but it takes away a
square from Black's knight, the g4 square.} O-O 14. Nb3 {Kasparov closes in on
the isolated a5 pawn. After he captures it the white pieces will be a little
tied up and during that time Black needs to counterattack vigorously on the
kingside. Instead from now on we watch Kasparov consolidate on the queenside
while X3D Fritz does absolutely nothing on the kingside. It has no clue that
its only hope is to play its kingside pawns forward to break through the white
pawn chain at its base.} Bd6 $6 {This got a good laugh from the Grandmaster
commentators and the audience. Only a computer! It puts its bishop right where
the white pawn can capture it. If Kasparov takes the bishop he loses his queen
after 15.cxd6?? Nxb6 and the white queen is trapped. Of course Kasparov
isn't going to blunder his queen away, so did this curious move have any other
value? Maybe so, if Black thinks its bishop is more useful on the b8-h2
diagonal, attacking the kingside.} (14... Ne8 15. Rb1 f5 {Here is the key move
that X3D Fritz never wanted to play. All of Black's hopes are pinned on
eventually breaking through with ..f5.} 16. g3 g5 {Necessary to enforce ...f4,
but X3D Fritz has been taught not to move the pawns in front of its king. Now
a double-edge battle is underway and White will have to watch out for Black's
breakthrough on the kingside. In the game, Kasparov never had to worry about
this at all since X3D Fritz never touched its f-pawn.}) 15. Rb1 
{Kasparov ignores X3D Fritz's provocative play and continues 
to develop his pieces. Black
isn't threatening anything.} (15. cxd6 $4 Nxb6) (15. Nxa5 Nxb6 16. cxb6 Bxa3
17. Qxa3 Qxb6) 15... Be7 $6 {Oh boy, now you know we're in the land of
computer chess. As one of America's top players, GM Gregory Kaidanov, put it
after the game, "this move showed that the computer doesn't feel any
embarrassment!" X3D Fritz puts its bishop right back where it was two moves
ago, basically making Kasparov a gift of two moves.} 16. Nxa5 Nb8 17. Bb4 {
Kasparov will slowly unravel his pieces on the queenside and prepare to push
his a2 pawn up the board where it will break through and give him a protected
passed b-pawn with an easily winning position. X3D Fritz can't see this coming
at all and does nothing but watch.} Qd7 18. Rb2 {This useless-looking move
confused most of the commentators, but to anyone with extensive anti-computer
chess experience it makes perfect sense. The rook protects the f2 pawn, a
potential weak spot, but why would you protect something that isn't being
attacked? The reason goes into how computers think. It's brute force
calculation can only go so deep, even with four super-fast processors. Black's
only possible source of counterplay in this position is to push its f-pawn and
open up an attack against area around the white king, f2 in particular. If X3D
Fritz's search, usually running 12-20 half-moves deep, ever reaches a position
in which it sees success in such an attack it will put such a plan in motion. 
 On the other hand, if it cannot reach a favorable position in its searches
it will never play the initial moves required. With the rook on b2 protecting
f2 already, the potential weakness of that critical square is somewhat hidden
from the computer's search. X3D Fritz can't just play it anyway like a human
would, knowing that everything else is useless. A machine has to receive a
positive evaluation from its search to play a move and always plays the move
that gives it the best evaluation. Since X3D Fritz sees no danger here for
itself it is content to play moves that do nothing, but don't cause any
negative effect either. It twiddles its virtual reality thumbs. Any human
would say, "I have to do SOMETHING."} Qe6 19. Qd1 {Getting the queen out from
behind the pin on the a5 knight. All of Kasparov's moves are based on
supporting the push of the extra a2 pawn, with the occasional need to protect
against an X3D Fritz threat.} Nfd7 {After this there was a brief hope that X3D
Fritz had found the need to play its f-pawn at long last.} 20. a3 Qh6 21. Nb3

the f2 pawn against the king and so threatens ...Qxe3+ on the next move.} 22.

are so few legal moves in this closed position. It was like casting a powerful
searchlight into a black hole. Even reaching 19 half-moves ahead it couldn't
find the essential plan.} 27. a4 {The a-pawn begins its march.} Ng6 28. a5 Ne7
{After all this silliness it's too late for X3D Fritz to do anything now even
if it realized it was in trouble. It's pieces are all on the other side of the

1. d4 {Already a bit of a surprise from X3D Fritz. Computers almost always
play 1.e4 against humans because it leads to open positions with sharper, more
concrete play, at least speaking very broadly. Of course any chess opening can
lead to a sharp position, as we see here. The X3D Fritz team had a specific
opening line in mind when they went for 1.d4 in this critical game four.} d5 {
For a long time Kasparov played 1...Nf6 exclusively against 1.d4. That move
usually led to the aggressive Grunfeld or King's Indian Defenses. Lately,
however, he has been playing the more solid move here, staking out space in
the center right from the start. After the game Kasparov said that he wasn't
completely surprised by 1.d4 and had done some preparation with his seconds
for the match, Grandmasters Yuri Dokhoian and Mikhail Kobalia. (Dokhoian is
his long-time trainer.)} 2. c4 {The Queen's Gambit, offering a pawn to deflect
Black's central d-pawn from its solid post. This has been one of the most
common opening systems at every level of the game.} dxc4 {The Queen's Gambit
Accepted, as Black accepts the offer of the pawn. Unlike other gambits Black
only rarely attempts to hold on to his extra pawn in this variant. Doing so
subjects him to too much attacking pressure. Instead he develops his pieces.
Kasparov has played this before but the commentators weren't sure he would
enter such an open, double-edged opening against X3D Fritz.} 3. Nf3 e6 4. e3

much activity and piece power on the board as possible to press the computer's
advantage in tactics and calculation.} Qxd1 8. Rxd1 Bxc5) (7. a4 Nc6 8. Qe2
cxd4 9. Rd1 Be7 10. exd4) 7... cxd4 {Kasparov heads into a line he has played
before. You can see why the X3D Fritz team liked this line. All the pieces are
still on the board and there are open lines for attack and piece play. There
are no lines of blocked pawns to inhibit the computer's calculating ability.
The downside is unrelated to the objective characteristics of the position.
It's that Kasparov knows this position very well and is likely to have studied
it deeply. This turns out to have been exactly the case.} (7... b5 {
This move, quickly developing the bishop to b7, is the most popular here.} 8.
a4 b4 9. Nbd2 Bb7) 8. exd4 {Now White has what we call an isolated queen's
pawn, a very common structure. The pawn on d4 has no pawns alongside it to
defend it and it can be a target for Black's forces. In compensation White has
excellent open lines for developing his pieces and the pawn controls important
center squares. It is also possible to advance the pawn to start an attack.}
Nc6 9. Nc3 Be7 10. Re1 O-O 11. Bf4 {This move made it clear to Kasparov that
the X3D Fritz team was headed into a line that was played in several very
high-profile games a few years ago. Kasparov played in two of them, one with
white in 1999 and one with Black in 2001! That 2001 game was against no lesser
an opponent than world #2 Vladimir Kramnik on the stage in Moscow. Kasparov
had won that game and no one had dared to play that line for White since then.
Kasparov now started to play slower, warily looking ahead for what X3D Fritz
had in mind. More precisely, what the X3D opening book team had in mind. The
machine was still playing out of its opening library, not thinking on its own
at all. There is a dead giveaway by the way the machine plays its moves
instantaneously when it is still in its database book. When that's going on
Kasparov knows that he is still following the programmers' preparation.} Na5 {

After this Kasparov went into a very long think. He had faced this exact
position two years ago in Moscow against his arch-rival, world #2 Kramnik.
They were playing a match of blitz, games with just five minutes per player
instead of the two hours plus of classical chess. Kasparov's was wondering if
he should continue to follow the line from that game. He beat Kramnikspectacula
rly in that 2001 blitz game by sacrificing his queen and winning a wild
tactical melee. But surely trying that against X3D Fritz would be close to
suicide. It was just that sort of position the computer team dreamed of when
they told X3D Fritz to play this line if given the chance. So Kasparov sat
there for a while looking at the alternatives. He was mentally thumbing
through his years of memorized analysis and looking to see what dangerous
improvements the X3D Fritz team might have found.} exd5 {Kasparov avo ids the
wild queen sacrifice line and recaptures with the pawn. Grandmaster Yasser
Seirawan, one of the ESPN commentators, didn't like this line at all against a
computer because of the many open lines. The alternatives were worse, however,
at least according to Kasparov. This move has also been played before in top
level games and this is a factor in Kasparov's favor. He would definitely have
analyzed those games.} (13... Nxd5 {

Keeping the bishop on the board and pinning the knight on f6 against the queen.
} Rb8 17. Qxa6 {Kasparov was relieved when the computer actually thought for a
while before playing this obvious move. That meant it was finally out of its
opening library and he wasn't out of his! Now he didn't have to worry about a
nasty prepared surprise. Kasparov had analyzed this position extensively in
the past and didn't think Black had anything to fear.} Rxb2 18. Bxf6 {
Making things easier for Kasparov. The world #1 had already seen through to
the completely equal endgame that is now coming. X3D Fritz could have kept
more material on the board instead of exchanging, but it doesn't know how to
do anything other than play the best move. If a move that simplifies is rated
as 0.01 points better than an incredibly complicated move it will play the
simplifying move even though it would have much better winning chances against
a human by playing the complicating move. One thing the X3D Fritz team might
not have been aware of is that the previous game to reach this position was
played by GM Andrei Kharlov, a Russian who has been part of Kasparov's
analysis team several times. This would significantly increase the chance that
Kasparov would know this line inside and out.} (18. Re2 Rxe2 19. Qxe2 Be7 20.

the danger was past. Black has absolutely no winning chances in these lines as
there is no way X3D Fritz is going to make a huge blunder. In simple, open
positions computers are all but invincible. The draw was now becoming apparent.

here because he is threatening checkmate in two moves. Of course X3D Fritz had
seen all this coming too. Still, it's a pretty way to end a rather technical
final game. Both sides have serious back-rank problems; their kings have no
way to escape a check on the rank. With all the heavy pieces on the board this
creates various tricks, but both Kasparov and X3D Fritz were up to the task.}

first.} 27. Qd8+ (27. Rc1 {Any human would have played this move just to see
if Black might blunder. It isn't immediately obvious how Black can deal with
the threat of Rc8+ with a winning attack. The black rook can't go to a8 and if
it blocks with ..Rc2 then Qd8+ Kh7 Qd3+ wins the rook with a fork. Three-time
US Champion Joel Benjamin was momentarily alarmed, thinking that perhaps
Kasparov had missed this trick in what looked like a safe position at last.}
