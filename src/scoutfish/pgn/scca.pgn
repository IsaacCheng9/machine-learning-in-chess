controls c8 and f1. black cannot attempt to bring hir king to e8 because White
would play Bb5 and Rh7 posing new threats. the position is very complicated

black. In chess simply you have to choose, so committing yourself to the
consequences. Black took his decisions and lost. He was bold enough (credit

origional idea of my own, developed ia a series of OTB games over the past
couple of years or so between myself and my local friend, George McRobert, so
I was not following theory. Much later during this game I was to discover that
this opening sequence of moves had indeed been played before by a number of
English Grandmasters from the early 1980's onwards. My own experience with
this opening led me to believe that this  was a very strong sequence for White
to play, and it actually caused  George McRobert to discard the St. George
from his repertoire, so overwhelming was my score against him with it!!} 5...
Bb4+ ({5...b5xc4 is normal here but 5...Bb4+ here serves as an inbetween move.

Threatening 9...Bxf3, which would either double my f-pawns or win a pawn,
liquidating the White centre in the process, so...} 9. Bf4 d5 10. Bd3 c5 {
So now what we have is effectively a Winawer French Defence, with thedifference
being that Black has exchanged his b-pawn for White's c-pawn and fianchettoed
his queen's Bishop, so now ...Bxc3 isn't really much of a threat because White
doesn't get doubled c-pawns and b2xc3 further supports the White centre, so
White would have no objection to this course of events.} 11. Be3 cxd4 12. Bxd4

back to what it should have been had I played the corrrect 14.Rc1. The correct
move for Black here was the immediate 15...Nc5!, and the Bishop cannot go to
b1 because it would block in the Rook, and so White would have to play 16.Bc2,
which would slow down his game a fair bit from what actually occured! There
was no urgency for either side to castle!} 16. Rac1 Nc5 17. Bb1 Ng6 18. b4 $1

{This is a strategic error. Black should've played 22...Nxc5 23.b4xc5 with
queenside play for White. To be fair to Black, he had his own ideas of
exchanging off his Knight for my Bishop and in the process opening up the long
diagonal for his Queen's Bishop, but I refuted this in the following manner....

also threatening 29.Be6...h7.g6. On a3 the Black Knight is on the edge of the
board far away from where it would be needed, attacking, defending, and
influencing nothing on a3, therefore a waste of amove!} 28. Nxf5 Ne4 29. Bxe4

the focal square for the White Knight, now it's d6!} 30... Rxf1+ 31. Rxf1 Rxc5

controls the f-file it is safe for the Black Queen to move off the back rank),
36.Qd8+ Nf8 37.Rxe2 Qa4!!  and Black sacrifices his Bishop on g2 with check if
necessary, but in return attains at least perpetual check! S, it was my
renewedintention in the event that Black played 32...Bd5, to answer 33.Rd1.
However, with the Bishop now having been played to c6, the Black Queen no
longer has this important transit square, so it was now perfectly safe  and
strong for White to play...} 33. h4 $1 Nf8 $2 34. Qe7 Ng6 35. Qf7+ {This is a p
erfectly good, strong winning move and continuation. However, I missed a
forced mate here, which ran as follows: -} (35. Qe6+ Kh8 36. Nf7+ Kg8 37. Nd8+

about it!} 1-0

{My first foray into the world of email international chess began in the
Spring of 1999. Most games needed only 3 or 4 months to complete. The one that
I have chosen for annotating took a bit longer, as my Brazilian opponent had
to sell his own computer and arrange to forward the email from a borrowed

the right time for Black to play this, limiting the c8 Bishop.} 8. e3 O-O 9.

the pawn capture anyway. After all, the c8 h3 diagonal is available again.} 11.

this.} 15. Bg3 Nc6 16. Nh2 {This was prompted by the attractive opening of the
d1 h5 diagonal in an attempt to combine Bishop and Queen against h7.} 16... Ne7

does not seem to break through. Black has enough defenders to ward off the
threats.} 17... h5 {Another pawn in front of the king! No battening down of
hatches here. I decided to respond with a pawn thrust of my own, to give my g3
Bishop somewhere to retreat and to break things up a bit.} 18. f4 h4 19. Be1

advanced pawns to follow.} 20. fxg5 fxg5 21. Rxf8+ Rxf8 22. Qe2 {

Harassing the Queen may not be the best here. Perhaps Bf5 instead.} 29. Qd2 Rf7

{Queen's Gambit. In the following game my opponent was an over the board
Grandmaster and obviously a much better player than me. The one advantage was
that I had access to a number of his games and was able to predict the opening.
I chose a wild complicated opening which would have been suicide over the
board, However in correspondence I reckoned that the abundance of theory would
enable me to obtain a safe edge. Of course this idea is a load of rubbish.} 1.

French tarrasch in the past 10 or so years. White normally exchanges on f6,
but a hardcore of Scandinavian and postal players prefer Nf4 here, leading to
an exciting struggle where Black drops an exchange (the Rook on h8) but gets a
strong centre and good development for it. John Watson prefers 7...Qb6 in Play

11. Nf3 Qc7 12. Nc3 {An old line, but there is nothing wrong with White's plan.
Black is more or less forced to play a6 to stop the threatened Nb5, but this
weakens the Black squares on the Queenside, notably c5 and b6. White could
then settle a Knight on c5 (via a4). pressurising e6, b7, a6 and probably
Black's White-squared Bishop. On the other hand, moving the Knight from e2
means White has less control over the squares g3 and f4, allowing Black
counterplay on the Kingside.} 12... a6 13. Bg5 O-O 14. Bh4 {White's idea is to
reduce pressure alonge the b8-h2 diagonal by offering an exchange of Bishops

it. It is nearly always dim to stick a Knight on the rim, but here the trusty

a Queen, two Rooks and a Knight against Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop and three
pawns. Barring a fluke, (eg if Black leaves Rxh6 tricks on) White can only
hope to pinch a draw through a perpetual check, or by holding an endgame
material down. Black does best to finish the game before an endgame, as
although he has three good passed pawns, the Bishop controls only one Queening
square, and his King is poorly placed to help them Queen. All Black's pieces
are working well, with the minor pieces doing sterling defensive duty as well
as playing their part in attack. The White King is dangerously exposed against
four good Black pieces, but actively placed should White get the Queen's off.
With a modicum of alertness on his part Black's King is safe where it is for
the present. These factors mean Black's best strategy is still to go for the
White King.}
