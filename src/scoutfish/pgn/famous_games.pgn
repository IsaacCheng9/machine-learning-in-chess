{Now White, keeping in mind the theme of the previous variations, sees that he can achieve his goal of a passed d-pawn. He notices that the pawn at e4 is not a material consideration in this position.} 
41.Ne6 Nb3 
{Of course Black cannot even think about exchanging at e6 and entombing the bishop. 41...Nxe4 42.Kxe4 Rxe2+ 43.Kd4 is a winning endgame for White, since the bishop is absolutely useless and the king is closeenough} 
42.c5 dxc5 43.Nxc5 Nd2+ 44.Kf2 Ke7

{and here Black should have stuck to his plan, instead of belatedly switching to the queenside advance. 46...Kd6! gives drawing chances.}

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 
{This is one of the sharpest variations of the French Defense. It was the subject of a number of important World Championship games, with Botvinnik playing the Black side against both Smyslov and Tal.} 
Qc7 
{This variation is no longer popular, having been replaced by 6...Ne7.} 
7.Qg4 
{A very aggressive move typical of the Winawer Variation of the French. But the more solid 7.Nf3 is now preferred, having been honed into a fine weapon by Anatoly Karpov.} 
f5 
{The main lines of the Winawer could still have been reached had Black chosen to develop the knight. Unlike most World Championship matches, which start out like boxing matches with a cautious first round, this is an early slugfest. 7...Ne7 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9.Qxh7 cxd4 10.Kd1 This is a popular line, similar to the game, which is known as the "Life or Death Variation".} 
8.Qg3 Ne7 9.Qxg7 Rg8 10.Qxh7 
{The difference between this and the line in the previous note is that here the queen cannot easily retreat to help defend the king.} 
cxd4 11.Kd1 
{This is not such a good idea here, because the queen is in exile at h7. Tal, in his notes to the game, indicates that this eccentric move has pretty much vanished from the tournament arena. The move was originally recommended by Euwe.} 
Bd7 
{This bishop is headed to h4, where it can participate in an attack against White's king.} 
12.Qh5+ Ng6 
{12...Kd8 13.Bg5 White has a strong attack.} 
13.Ne2 
{White threatens Nf4, adding pressure to the pin on the knight at g6.} 
d3 
{This forces White to weaken the a4-d1 diagonal.} 
14.cxd3 Ba4+ 15.Ke1 Qxe5 
{An obvious move but it is actually a bit slow. In order to attack successfully Black needs more power, and so developing the Nb8 would have been better. 15...Nc6 16.f4 O-O-O 17.Bd2 Tal notes that sooner or later Black will sacrifice the knight at e5, with complications which are hard.} 
16.Bg5

17.d4 Qc7 
{17...Qe4 18.Rc1 keeps the enemy queen out.} 
18.h4 
{The point of this move is not to advance the passed pawn. Instead, it prepares a rook lift Rh1-h3-e3.} 
e5 19.Rh3 Qf7 
{The best defense was probably 19...e4, securing important central territory and creating an outpost at d3.} 
20.dxe5 Ncxe5 21.Re3 
{This pin is important not because it wins the knight (it doesn't) but rather because it forces the Black king to move off of the e-file. White is beginning to establish an initiative.} 
Kd7 22.Rb1 b6 
{The bishop is no longer doing much at a4 and so 22...Bc6 might have been a wiser move.} 
23.Nf4 
{White now enjoys a clear initiative. Black remains on the defensive for the rest of the game.} 
Rae8 
{23...Rh8 24.Nxg6 Nxg6 25. Qe2 and the queen attacks from the other flank by moving to a6!} 
24.Rb4 Bc6 
{Now we see that 22...b6 was just a waste of time.} 
25.Qd1 
{Her mission accomplished on the kingside, the queen returns home.} 
Nxf4 
{25...Ng4 26.Rxe8 Rxe8+ 27.Ne2 Black is in deep trouble, and has no real compensation for the passed pawn on the h-file.}

{After a series of forced moves material balance is restored, but Black's king is still stuck in the center and his forces are scattered.} 
Ne4 
{The only assets in Black's position are the centralized pawn at d5 and knight at e4. The only defensive piece is the bishop at g7. Watch how quickly Tal reduces these to rubble.} 
21.Nf5 Qe5 22.Nxg7+ Qxg7 
{Campomanes, who loves tactics above all else, must have felt pretty good here, since it seems that the initiative is now in his hands, thanks to the attack on the bishop. Next move he will castle to safety...NOT!}

17.Bxf4 gxf4

6.Bg5 
{The main line. Black cannot afford to have the kingside pawn structure broken up by a capture at f6.}

8.Qd2 h6 9.Bxf6 Nxf6 10.O-O-O

e6 11.Rhe1 Be7 12.f4 O-O 13.Bb3 Re8

{Spassky launches an all-out attack. Black has to accept the proffered pawn or else it will be shoved down his throat!}

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 c5 4.exd5 exd5 5.Ngf3 Nc6 6.Bb5 Bd6 7.dxc5 Bxc5 
{This is called an "isolated queen pawn" (IQP) position because the pawn at d5 cannot be protected by any other pawn. The pawn is weak and White will try to win it, but Black has counterplay on the adjacent open files.} 
8.O-O Nge7 9.Nb3 Bd6 
{In IQP positions like these White has two main objectives: the blockade of the isolated pawn and the elimination of Black's dark-squared bishop.} 
10.Bg5 
{This move directly implements White's plan by transfering the bishop to a post from which it can reach the h2-g8 diagonal (via h4 to g3).} 
O-O 11.Bh4 Bg4 12.Be2 Bh5 
{The superior 12... Re8! had already been introduced by Uhlmann, but he was probably afraid of a prepared innovation.} 
13.Re1 Qb6 14.Nfd4 
{Not only does White achieve half of his goal, but he also places Black in a position where he faces a difficult decision concerning the fate of the Bh5.} 
Bg6 
{If Black had exchanged bishops the isolated pawn would have less protection. Uhlmann decides that the bishop may be of use at e4, since any eventual f2-f3 will weaken the a7-g1 diagonal.} 
15.c3 Rfe8 16.Bf1 Be4 17.Bg3 
{Now that all of White's pieces have been properly positioned, the exchange of bishops is appropriate.} 
Bxg3 18.hxg3 
{White need not worry about the doubled g-pawns. They are actually strong from both offensive and defensive perspectives.} 
a5 
{The weakening of b5 is probably more significant than Black's mild initiative, but perhaps the move was played without taking into consideration White's potential sacrifice of the b-pawn.} 
19.a4 Nxd4 20.Nxd4 
{Karpov correctly maintains the blockade with the piece, since if 20...Qxb2 then 21.Nb5! threatens both 22.Nc7 and 22.Re2.} 
Nc6 
{The position remains rather closed, and the e-file is the only line which can be exploited. To do this, White must drive the Re8 away.} 
21.Bb5 
{The pin encourages Black's rook to leave the e-file. Probably 21...Bg6 would have been best here.} 
Red8 22.g4 
{A very clever move, the point of which is to create threats of trapping the enemy bishop should it retreat to g6 (with f2-f4-f5).} 
Nxd4 
{This is a major positional concession, since it leads to an endgame where Black has a bad bishop and White controls the e-file.} 
23.Qxd4 Qxd4 24.cxd4 Rac8 25.f3 Bg6 26.Re7 
{The immediate objective has now been achieved, and after the doubling of rooks on the e-file Karpov illustrates his famous endgame technique to secure the point.}

O-O 6.Nf3 c5 7.d5 e6 
{Vaiser stated after the game that this variation had served him well for the past 14 years.} 
8.Be2 exd5 
{Three years previous to this game Vaiser and I had played a blitz match. Every time I played Black we reached this position and Vaiser continued with 9.cxd5. However, I was in for an unpleasant surprise.} 
9.e5 
{The exclamation mark is based on psychological considerations. My opponent knew that of the three principal continuations, 9. exd5, 9.cxd5, and 9.e5, the third would come as the greatest surprise. Now I was improvising.} 
Ng4 10.cxd5 dxe5 11.h3 e4 12.hxg4 
{Before this game was played theory had ignored this move with 12.Nxe4 being preferred.} 
exf3 13.gxf3 
{Black's chief problem is his lack of useful squares for the development of his pieces on the queenside. Perhaps my experience at the board influences my pessimistic evaluation, today I would prefer to play White's position.} 
Re8 
{If I tried to prevent the advance f4-f5 by 13...f5, then the a2-g8 diagonal would be weakened, and that could prove the road to Black's destruction in the near future.}

{I recognized the danger facing the Black position, but decided to be consistent and took the pawn. Perhaps it will turn out all right...} 
16.Bxg7 Kxg7 
{The abundance of White's attacking possibilities is noticeable at first glance , but I comforted myself with the thought that not just any move would win.} 
17.f6+ 
{Well here the pace picked up...White couldn't hold himself back from storming the walls of the king's fortress and sends in a single column of attack. 17.Rc1 During the game it seemed to me that this move was not sufficiently forcing. Detailed analysis, however, later showed that I was wrong.} 
Kg8 
{In this position I began to glance at the White king which has remained in the center.} 
18.Qc1 
{Vaiser proposes an endgame, where his opponent's lag in development and the strong pawn on f6 would be factors operating in White's favor. But has he got a surprise coming!} 
Qb4 
{This move seems suicidal, since the entrance of the White queen to h6 creates two deadly threats. However, I was well prepared for this.} 
19.Kf1 
{White should have regrouped and, putting aside his ambitious thoughts, come to terms with the leveling of chances. 19.Qd2 should be preferred. 19.Qd2 Nd7 20.Rb1 Qd4 21.Qxd4 cxd4 22.Ne4 d3 23.Bxd3 Nxf6 24.Kf2 Nxd5 25.Rb5 is good for White due to the weak f6 square.} 
Nd7 20.Bb5 
{This move looks pretty convincing-there seems no way to keep the White queen from reaching the coveted h6 square. 20.Qh6 Nxf6 when Black's king is safe.} 
Qd4 21.Kg2 
{21.Qh6 Nxf6 22.Bxe8 Qxc3 23.Kg2 Bxg4 24.Bxf7+ Kxf7 25.fxg4 Re8 when White's can do nothing against the united strength ofBlack's} 
Re3 
{This move is much stronger than the "greedy" 21...Qxf6, which would give White considerable counterplay. 21...Qxf6 22.Qh6 Qg7 23.Ne4 when Black has problems developing his queenside due to the pinned knight.} 
22.Ne2 Qe5 23.Kf2 Rxe2+ 24.Bxe2 Nxf6 
{Now one can sum up the results of White's "blitzkrieg". His attack has been exhausted, and the extra exchange hardly carries any importance. Black has two pawns for it, and the open position of White's king allow favorable tactics.} 
25.Qxc5 
{In avoiding the worst, White heads for an endgame, but Black manages to win another pawn, after his advantage is beyond doubt. It should be noted that we were both in time trouble at this point.} 
Bxg4 26.Qe3 
{26.fxg4 allows Black to win White's queen.} 
Qxe3+ 27.Kxe3 Nxd5+ 28.Kf2 Be6 29.Rab1

{Here the game was adjourned, but White, having sealed 41.Kh4, resigned before resumption. One could argue with this, but Black does have a clear path to victory. For example (see variation). 40...h5 41.Kh4 Rb3 42.Rg3 Rb1 43.Re3 Rg1 44.Rg5 Rh1+ 45.Kg3 f5 cutting off the rook from the queenside.}

{See, I couldn't have done this if his knight were at b3 because then after 13.Rd1 Be6 his c-pawn would be defended by the bishop at c1.} 
13.Nd5 
{Here I thought for over an hour, a personal record at the time. Usually when I think for a long time, I tend to play the most aggressive line. Here it involves a sacrifice. 13.Rd1 Be6 14.Nc1 Rc8 15.Qxd6 Nd4 16.Qxd8 Rexd8 17.b3 b5 Black has an initiative on the queenside.} 
b5 14.Bb6 Qd7 15.Nc7 Rb8 16.Nxe8 Qxe8

17.Be3 
{Black may b e the exchange down, but I have an initiative due to the lack of development in White's camp. 17.cxb5 Rxb6 18.bxc6 d5 The game is opening up and I have pressure on the center, while White's king is stuck in the center.}

{At this point White must determine his strategy for the remainder of the game. His goal is to infiltrate the kingside, and exploit the weak light squares. 26...Ne4 27.Bxe4 fxe4 28.Nxe4 is clearly better for White, with a SuperKnight at e4 and threats along the g-file.}

{I should have played 20...Nc5, because time was important. 20...Nc5 21.Nxc5 bxc5 22.Rd3 Nd4 23.Rh3 Qe7 My defenses should be sufficient.} 
21.Rd3 Nb4 22.Rh3 Bg7

23.Be3 
{One of the most important decisions of Karpov's World Championship career, and one which may have cost him the title. Deep analysis later revealed the best line, but Karpov played this move after just a few minutes. 23.f5 exf5 24.exf5 Bxg2+ 25.Kxg2 Qb7+ 26.Kg1 Rc5 A complicated position, with chances for both sides. But there are many byways toexplore!}

24.Kg1 
{Karpov now waits to see what I have in mind, but this is not so simple, since my next move is seemingly absurd.} 
Rce8 
{Why am I doubling rooks on the closed e-file? Karpov must have asked himself this question more than once. But there is a good reason. Now if White plays 25.f5, I can open up the e-file. And I have kingside aspirations, too.} 
25.Rd1 
{The best reply. Now it is my turn to find an effective move.}

Nf6 31.Rh4

g5 32.fxg5 Ng4 
{I want to get rid of the bishop at e3.} 
33.Qd2 Nxe3 34.Qxe3 Nxc2 35.Qb6 
{A strong move. But Karpov was running short of time and my next move added further confusion to the position.} 
Ba8 
{At the time, I thought Karpov's position was indefensible, but it turns out that it was more complicated than I thought. Fortunately, he blundered here.} 
36.Rxd6 
{After this move Karpov is lost, if I play correctly. 36.Qxb8 Rxb8 37.Bh3 Re7 38.Rxd6 Rxb3 39.Rd8+ Kf7 40.Rxa8 Rxb2 This is still a very messy position, but my analysis indicates that I come out on top.} 
Rb7 37.Qxa6 Rxb3 
{I missed a more effective line here. I moved too quickly, influenced both by Karpov's time pressure and the feeling that victory was near. 37...Nb4 38.Qa5 Qxd6 39.e5 Qd3 40.Bxb7 Qe3+ 41.Kf1 Nd3 Mate at f2 is threatened.} 
38.Rxe6 Rxb2 39.Qc4 Kh8 40.e5 
{Karpov had just a few seconds left. Had he found the best move, his "reward" would have been a losing endgame. 40.g6 h5 41.Rxe8+ Qxe8 42. Nd1 Na3 43.Qf7 Qxf7 44.gxf7 Rb1 45.Bf3 Nc4 46.Rf4 Rb8 My extra piece is worth more than the three scattered pawns.} 
Qa7+ 41.Kh1 Bxg2+ 42.Kxg2 Nd4+ 
{This wins a whole rook. Karpov pondered for a few minutes and then congratulated me both on my victory in this game and on winning the World Championship.}

Bxc6 30.Bxc6 Nf4 
{Black's control of the b- and c-files, combined with the pin on the diagonal and more active knights gives him a decisive advantage!} 
31.Bb5 
{Timman tries to cut off the b-file, establish his own pin on the c- file, and free his game with Rc1. Black would just love to get his queen onto the a8-h1 diagonal with deadly threats at g2. This is easily done! 31.Re8+ Rxe8 32.Bxe8 Nce6 exploits the pin at d4, with a little help from the threatened fork at e2.} 
Rxb5 32.Nxb5 Qc6 33.f3 Qxb5

34.Bxg7 Kxg7 35.Qc3+ Kg8 36.Qe5 Nfe6 37.Ra1 Qb7

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Nf3 
{Until now I had mostly played 4.e3, the most common move. But I wanted to surprise Karpov in this initial game of our match.} 
c5 5.g3 
{This system, often used by Oleg Romanishin, really caught Karpov off-guard, and he thought for a long time before responding. This may explain why he quickly deviated from the best-known variations.} 
Ne4 6.Qd3 Qa5 
{Capturing at d4 is normal.} 
7.Qxe4 Bxc3+ 8.Bd2 Bxd2+ 9.Nxd2 Qb6 
{A mistake. For a few years this position had been bouncing around, and I had prepared it well. But even after 9...Nc6 White stands well.} 
10.dxc5 Qxb2 11.Rb1 Qc3 12.Qd3 
{This forces an endgame which is clearly better for White. If the queen retreats then after 13.Bg2 Black is paralyzed.} 
Qxd3 13.exd3 Na6 
{13...Nc6 14.Bg2 b6 15.Ne4 Ke7 16.Kd2 f5 17.cxb6 axb6 18.Nc3 Black has too many weaknesses to hold out for long.} 
14.d4 Rb8 
{Better was 14...e5, but I still would have had a superior position. Karpov rarely parts with pawns unless it is absolutely necessary.} 
15.Bg2 Ke7 16.Ke2 
{I slipped up here. Usually in the endgame the king belongs in the center, but there are a few tactics lying around which should have led me to simply castle onto the kingside.} 
Rd8 17.Ne4 b6 18.Nd6 Nc7 
{Karpov's idea -- exchanging for the knight at d6 via Ne8 -- is a good one, but there was an even stronger move available. 18...bxc5 19.Nxc8+ Rdxc8 20.Bb7 Rxb7 The point! 21.Rxb7 cxd4 22.Rxa7 Nc5 Black has a strong position in the center and a well-posted knight, which provide a lot of compensation for the exchange.} 
19.Rb4 
{I am preparing to double rooks on the b-file.} 
Ne8 20.Nxe8 
{Not best. I should have taken the bishop instead. Perhaps I was influenced by the fact that it hadn't made a single move yet!} 
Kxe8 
{Karpov returns the favor by capturing with the wrong piece! His forces all lie powerless on the back rank -- a pretty pathetic sight that could only appeal to a player like Petrosian.} 
21.Rhb1 Ba6 22.Ke3 d5 23.cxd6 
{An example of an en passant capture.} 
Rbc8 24.Kd3 
{In this first game I was not a full strength and missed the simple and effective winning line. 24. Ra4 Bxc4 25.Bb7 b5 26.d7+ Kxd7 27.Bxc8+ Kxc8 28.Rxa7} 
Rxd6 25.Ra4 b5 26.cxb5 Rb8 27.Rab4 
{Breaking the pin on the b-file, but now Black can regroup.}

{The game has developed along Classical lines. Even though Karpov chooses the Nimzoindian Defense, he isn't really a Hypermodern player at heart. So it is somewhat strange that he prematurely concedes the center with this move.} 
10.Bxc4 Nc6 11.O-O Be7 
{Actually, I have an extra tempo by comparison with most Queen's Gambit positions. We have left the world of the Nimzoindian for good, and the excursion of the bishop from f8 to b4 and back to e7 is just a waste of time.} 
12.Re1 b6 13.a3 Bb7 14.Bg3 Rc8 15.Ba2 Bd6

{The real point of this move is to transfer the queen to the kingside. But it also sets a trap.} 
Rfd8 21.Rcd1 
{I am dangling the b-pawn as bait. Karpov is much too good a player to fall for the trap, but perhaps the distraction caused him to create a situation on the h3-c8 diagonal he would quickly come to regret.} 
Rd7

{This is a useful square for the queen, putting pressure on d4 and forcing the bishop to stay at home to guard the pawn at b2. A typical hypermodern strategy.}

{20.Qd2 Qxe4 Now White can win the queen but still winds up with a bad game. 21. Nd4 Qxd4 22.Rxd4 Nxd4 Black has a only rook and a bishop for the queen, but there is pressure at e5 and the minor pieces will work well together.}

{The familiar variation worked out by Igor Zaitsev, Karpov's trainer, in the late 1970's. It is the most popular line these days.} 
11.Nbd2 Bf8

16.Rxa4 a5 17.Ra3

{Pretty much the same idea. The d-pawn can advance and then the rook helps protect the kingside.} 
18.Nh2 g6 19.f3

Qd7 20.Nc4 Qb5 21.Rc3 Bc8

22.Be3 Kh7 23.Qc1 c6 
{This is a b ad move, because it defeats the purpose of placing the rook at a6. Now it can play no role on the kingside. Better was 23...Qd8.}

{My opponent's last move is an attempt to create a hole on the d4-square. This is a potential weakness in White's center, specially if a Black knight can be posted there.}

{Since his Black square bishop is missing, Belyavsky's position is vulnerable on the dark squares.} 
15.f4 Nc6 16.Qa3 e5 
{As a general rule, it is unwise to open the position up when your opponent has two bishops and you have only one. Furthermore, advancing the pawn from e6 to e5 creates a hole in the d5-square.}

{My opponent fight's back by centralizing his Knight to e5. However, he has a horrible gash in his position in the shape of the d5 hole.} 
22.Be4 
{I now have four pieces aiming at the d5 square. Also, the isolated pawn at d6 is under attack due to the combined efforts of the White queen and rook. Lastly, Belyavsky has yet to develop his queenside. Black is lost.}

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 d6 4.Nc3 g6 5.e4 Bg7 
{Fischer plays a Benoni-style King's Indian. After a brief spell in a transpositional Twilight Zone, the game returns to well-known channels.} 
6.Bd3 
{This is a more reliable move than 6.Bg5.} 
O-O 7.Nf3 
{Spassky plays conservatively, confident that Black's formation is not a solid one. The point is that by delaying e7-e6, Black will allow his opponent to recapture at d5 with the e-pawn, and the pawn structure will be good for White} 
Bg4 
{This is a well-known maneuver to fight for the e5 square, but we think that Black could have occupied that key square immediately with a good game. 7...e5 8.O-O Ne8 and f7-f5 will give Black an excellent position.} 
8.h3 Bxf3 9.Qxf3 
{The exchange of bishop for knight is a common theme in this variation. The bishop has little future in this pawn formation, and the two knights can be used effectively. Fischer has shown a preference for knights in this match.} 
Nbd7 10.Qd1 
{White avoids Ne5, which would have forked the bishop and queen, leading to the elimination of the powerful bishop.}

Ne8 
{12...Re8 13.Bd2 a6 14.a4 Re7} 
13.Bd2 Ne5 14.Be2 f5 
{Fischer employed an analogous idea in his game against Korchnoi from the Sousse Interzonal, 1967. The idea is to take control of e4 and stop f2-f4- f5.} 
15.f4 Nf7 
{The e6-square looks weak, but it is not easy to take advantage of this. Still, the knight should have gone to d7, from which it could retreat to f8 later if needed, or work on the queenside via b6.} 
16.g4 
{White's goal is to increase the activity of his bishop pair and take control of all the important dark squares, in particular e5 and f6.} 
Nh6 
{It is not easy to give a recommendation for Black here, but inviting g4- g5 was hardly the correct plan. There are two alternatives which come to mind, each of which may help justify Fischer's play in the opening. 16...fxg4 17. hxg4 g5!? undermines White's pressure at e5.} 
17.Kg2 
{17.g5 immediately would have been more accurate.} 
Nc7 18.g5 Nf7 19.Rb1 Re8 20.Bd3 Rb8 21.h4 a6 22.Qc2 b5 23.b3 
{White's general plan is to advance his h-pawn, while Black's potential queenside counterplay has been neutralized by this move. Fischer is a player who requires active piece play, and here he is suffocating.} 
Rb7 
{Fischer's play on the b-file will be futile. Spassky now increases the pressure slowly and surely.} 
24.Rbe1 Rxe1 25.Rxe1 Qb8 
{The threat is to capture on c4 and infiltrate on b2, but Spassky deprives Fischer of any such play with his next move.}

{The knight is being transfered to an attacking post at g3.} 
bxc4 28.bxc4 Ne8 29.h5 Re7 30.h6

Bh8 31.Bd2 Rb7 32.Rb1 Qb8 33.Ng3 Rxb1 34.Qxb1 Qxb1 35.Bxb1 
{The elimination of the heavy pieces favors White, since Black's remaining forces have no scope.} 
Bb2 36.Kf3 Kf8 
{White has achieved a winning position. Now perhaps the most efficient path to victory is the one which both Deep Thought and our analytical team prefer, namely the immediate sacrifice at f5.} 
37.Ke2 
{37.Nxf5 gxf5 38.Bxf5 Kg8 39.Bc8 and the a-pawn falls. Spassky chooses another path, and it is also convincing.} 
Nh8 
{An ugly move, but otherwise disaster could strike quickly. 37...Ke7 38.Nxf5+ gxf5 39.Bxf5 and the h-pawn falls.} 
38.Kd1 Ke7 39.Kc2 Bd4 40.Kb3 Bf2 41.Nh1

5.exd5 exd5 6.d3 
{Fischer deviates from game 17.} 
Nf6 
{6...Bg4 is not so good here: 7.Bg2 Nd4 8.h3 and White has the better game.} 
7.Bg2 Be7 8.Bg5 
{White threatens to exchange at f6, and increase pressure on the center. In the present match Fischer seems to have evidenced a disrespect for the common wisdom that bishops are stronger than knights.} 
d4 
{8...Be6 9.Nf4! Bg4 10.f3 Be6 11.Nxe6 fxe6 12.O-O will leave Black with the difficult task of defending the pawn at e6.}

{Black now has a slight advantage, threatening to capture at g2 and use the bishop pair to great effect.} 
29.Re4 
{Fischer is willing to argue that the knights are as strong as the bishops. 29.Be4 c4! leaves White in an uncomfortable position.} 
Nf5 
{The most sensible decision. 29...Nxg2 30.Kxg2 Rh8 31.Nf4! Bxf4 32. Rxf4 Rd8 33.Rh4 and now White stands better, as any exchange of rooks will provide an easy win.} 
30.Nf4 Ba2 
{Spassky wants to hang onto his bishop pair, trying to squeeze a full point from the position. The idea is to attack the base of the pawn chain with Bb1. 30...Bxf4 31.Rxf4 b6 would have provided an even endgame.}

{White starts the long trek to the pawn at f7.} 
Kd7 44.Kg3 Ke6 45.Na5

g6 4.Bxc6 bxc6 
{Theory prefers 4...dxc6, but there is nothing wrong with this choice.} 
5.O-O Bg7 6.Re1 e5 
{A critical advance, which prevents White from playing e4-e5 or d2-d4. But the blocking of the long diagonal creates an interesting opportunity for White. Spassky consistently rejects previous praxis, but opts for 6...f6 in game 13.} 
7.b4

{A very unusual move in this position, but it can lead to more normal lines if White chooses to transpose.} 
h5 9.Nc1 
{This is the real new idea. It is perhaps not an appropriate move in this position, though the real test does not come in the present game. 9.Qd2 Rb8 is also possible.} 
e5 
{9...Rb8!? 1 0.Nb3 Bd7 is more consistent with Black's strategy, aiming for an early break with b5.} 
10.d5 Ne7 
{10...Nd4 is probably stronger.} 
11.Be2 Nh7 
{Black prepares to launch kingside counterplay with f7-f5, after which the pawn at h4 can become very weak. His knights suffer from the lack of entry squares on the kingside, a situation brought about by 8...h5.} 
12.Nd3 
{White now contr ols f4 as well as g5, so there really is no possibility of kingside counterplay for Black.} 
f5 13.a4 
{White prevents Black from playing a freeing b7-b5. This shuts down any queenside action on Black's part.} 
Nf6 14.Nf2 
{This is the logical continuation of White's strategy, limiting Black's counterplay at each turn and taking control of more squares, in this case g4 and e4.} 
a5 
{A simply horrible move. it prevents a4-a5, but eliminates any chance of getting in b7-b5.} 
15.Qc2 c5 
{Another error, but a consistent follow-up to the previous mistake. Fischer must have underestimated White's potential energy on the kingside. 15...f4 16.Bd2 Bh6 17. g3 fxg3 18.Bxh6 gxf2+ was a better plan.} 
16.O-O-O b6 17.Rdg1 Nh7 18.Nb5 Kh8 
{Pointless, since the knight at e7 cannot be brought to h6 because White will plant a pawn at g5. 18...f4 might still be best, for example 19.Bd2 Rf7 20.g4 fxg3 21.Rxg3 Nf8 22.Nh3 Bxh3 23.Rgxh3}

1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7 5.Ng5 
{This has become all the rage in the past couple of years, despite the fact that it was considered harmless for decades! I am just fooling around, really. I intend to transpose back to the main lines soon enough.} 
Ngf6 6.Bc4 e6 7.Qe2 
{Now we are back in the familiar territory of opening theory.} 
Nb6 8.Bb3 
{This retreat offers more chances for complications than moving to d3, so it is just my kind of move.} 
h6 9.N5f3 c5 
{9...a5 is a promising alternative, but it does weaken the queenside and gives up any thoughts of castling queenside.} 
10.Bf4 Bd6 
{Unusual. More typical is 11...a6, which prepares a future b5. But this is very much in keeping with Karpov's style. He likes to simplify the position by exchanging pieces.} 
11.Bg3 Qe7 
{Black can also try 11...Qc7 or 11...O-O. But to exchange bishops at g3 would be pointless, from a strategic point of view, because I could use the h- file to great advantage.} 
12.dxc5 Bxc5 13.Ne5 Bd7 
{13...Nbd7 14.Ngf3 Nxe5 15.Nxe5 I would be satisfied with such a position as White.} 
14.Ngf3 
{14.O-O-O This would have laid a trap, but Karpov would no doubt have avoided it: 14...O-O-O?? 15.Nxf7 Qxf7 16.Qe5 Winning.} 
Nh5 15.O-O-O Nxg3 
{Now I get an open h-file but otherwise the bishop could have become a useful weapon. 15...O-O-O 16.Nxd7 Nxd7 17.Be5 Now Black would get in trouble if he captured at e5: 17...Nxe5 18.Nxe5 Nf4 19.Qc4} 
16.hxg3 O-O-O 
{This is a c ritical position. Black can claim equality against normal moves like Nxd7 or Rd3, but I came up with a very effective plan. Not only the spectators, but even my opponent had to re-evaluate the position.} 
17.Rh5 
{Karpov started to get visibly worried here. The threat is simply Nxf7, with a discovered attack on the bishop at c5. The pressure on the 5th rank is immense. The Gordian Knot can only be cut at very great cost.} 
Be8 
{17...g6 This was probably the best defense, even though it entails a serious weakening of the kingside pawn structure.} 
18.Rxd8+ Kxd8 19.Qd2+ Bd6 
{19...Kc8 20.Qc3 f5 21.Bxe6+ If Black takes the bishop, then I capture at c5. So the position is very good for me here.} 
20.Nd3 Qc7 21.g4 
{The advance of the g-pawn is part of my new strategy. Here Karpov plays rather passively.} 
Kc8 22.g5 Bf8 23.Rh4 Kb8 24.a4 Be7 
{This is a serious mistake which costs Karpov a critical tempo. 24...Nc8 25.g6 fxg6 26.Nd4 Black is under considerable pressure, but the game may not be lost yet.} 
25.a5 Nd5 26.Kb1 
{The point of this move is to get off of the c-file, so that I can advance the c-pawn.} 
Bd8 
{26...Rf8 27.Bxd5 exd5 28.Nb4 Bc6 29.gxh6 Bxh4 Now I have a very pretty combination to wrap things up: 30.Na6+ bxa6 31.Qb4+ Ka8 32.Qxf8+ Kb7 33.h7 The pawn reaches the promotion square.}

{13.b4 a5! prevents the planned advance of White's a-pawn to a5.} 
Bf8 14.Ng3 g6 15.Bg5 h6 16.Bd2 Bg7 17.a4 c5 18.d5 c4 19.b4 
{This is an , and perhaps a strong one. It is not just the move that is new, but the idea of a delayed b4 after Black has advanced to c4.} 
Nh7 20.Be3 h5 21.Qd2 Rf8 22.Ra3 
{Spassky must have been feeling a creeping uneasiness, caused by the potential problems on the a-file, where White's heavy artillery will congregate.} 
Ndf6 
{Black lacks adequate counterply, since there is no real hope of playing f7-f5. Therefore he tries to regroup his pieces to prevent a capture at b5, and also prepares to sacrifice a piece for the dominating central pawns.} 
23.Rea1 Qd7 24.R1a2 Rfc8 25.Qc1 Bf8 26.Qa1 Qe8 27.Nf1 Be7 28.N1d2 
{28.N3d2 is an interesting alternative, intending to advance the f-pawn.} 
Kg7 29.Nb1 
{This threatens to liquidate a lot of pieces following captures on a5 and a8, after which Nb1-a3 will win the weak pawn at b5. So Black must try a desperate sacrifice.} 
Nxe4 30.Bxe4 f5 31.Bc2 Bxd5 32.axb5 axb5 33.Ra7 Kf6 34.Nbd2 
{The knight has done its duty on the queenside and returns to provide support for the center and for its fellow steed at f3.} 
Rxa7 35.Rxa7 Ra8 36.g4 
{Fischer strives to open the position, even if this entails exposing his king to some danger. This is better than exchanging at a8, as the resulting simplification would not help White's attack.} 
hxg4 37.hxg4 Rxa7 38.Qxa7 f4 
{Well-timed! 38...Qa8 would lead to an easy win for White.} 
39.Bxf4 
{Fischer's  superb technique is evident as he returns his trophy immediately. If he had tried to hang on to it, victory would have been less likely. 39.Bb6?! Qa8! 40. Qd7 Bxf3 41.Nxf3 Qxf3 42.Bd8 Bxd8 43.Qxd8+ is unclear.} 
exf4 40.Nh4 
{Another strong move which is not obvious. The natural path would lead White astray: 40.Qd4+ Ke6 41.Qg7 Nf8 and Black can hold on.} 
Bf7 
{The fatal err or. The knight retreat was called for. 40...Nf8! 41.Qd4+ Ke6 42.Nf5 Bf6! 43. Qxf4 Be5 and Black could still put up a fight.} 
41.Qd4+ Ke6 42.Nf5 
{There is the threat of a big fork at g7.} 
Bf8 
{42...gxf5 43.Bxf5++} 
43.Qxf4 Kd7 44.Nd4 
{The b5-pawn is unprotected. Spassky makes one more attempt at counterplay.}
