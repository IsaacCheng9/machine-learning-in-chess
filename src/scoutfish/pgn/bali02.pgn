1. e4 c5
{ Although Shirov has played a variety of defenses, I think he's been playing the Petroff's Defense and perhaps the Caro-Kann most recently. }
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5
{ Neo-Sveshnikov or Lowenthal leaves d5 (and perhaps d6) weak. More common is 4...Nf6, forcing White to defend Pe4 and threatening ...d5. }

 ( 6. Bc4 ) ( 6. c4 ) 6...a6 7. Na3 b5
{ Instead of White dominating square c4 it's Black who controls it, for the moment. Eventually piece play should dominate a position more than pawns. There is also the immediate threat of ...b4. }
8. Nd5
{ White could continue with Bc1-e3-b6 and Nc7+, so Black has to react quickly. }
8...Nce7 9. c4 Nxd5 10. exd5 $5
{ This makes the pawns a bit unbalanced with White advancing on the queen-side. Aside from Pb5 Black shouldn't have much difficulty completing his development. }

 ) 12. Be3 Rb8 13. Be2 Be7 14. a4
{ aiming for a4-a5 and Nb6 or Bb6 to cramp Black, but making Pb2 backward! That and the slightly exposed Pd5 make White's position suspicous. Where's his offense coming from? I suppose he thinks it's necessary to use a Nb6 to defend Pd5, but ...Nf6-d7 can chase a Nb6 away, exposing Pb2. If he continues his queen-side advance then one of the pawns gives him the advantage. So, where's Black's offense come from? }

{ threatening Ba7 or Bc7 is a bit awkward for Black }
 ) 20. b4
{ If it's backward then trade it off. In this case b4-b5xa6 would make a passed pawn; ...a6xb5 does the same. }

 ) 20...Bd8 21. Be3 Bf6
{ threatening ...f4 and ...e5-e4-e3, but once that threat is avoided then what is Bf6 doing? }
 ( 21...Qf7 22. Bc4 Rc8 23. Qb3 ) 22. Rb1
{ Keeping the rook on the a-file, to back up Pa5, might be appealing, but Pb4 needs more immediate support. }

{ White doesn't want to play f3-f4 and leave Black with a protected passed pawn at e4. And, I understand that feeling. However, to open lines means to give Black other possibilities. }
25...Rfe8 26. Rb4
{ defending Pe4 and threatening Be2-b5 or a5-a6 seems correct }
26...Bc3
{ Now begins a forcing sequence. White doesn't want to move Rb4, so he threatens Black. }
27. Bb5 Qd8 28. Bxe8 Bxb4
{ Now what? Be8 and Pa5 are threatened. Obviously Be8 needs to move and threaten something or White needs to threaten Bb4 or Kg8. }
29. Bc6 ( 29. Qb1 Qxe8 30. Qxb4 Bxd5 $13 ) 29...Ba6
{ If Black can't trade off Bb7 then he's just lost a valuable tempo and White can take the advantage in the center by capturing Pf5. Pa5 becomes a casualty of the campaign. }

1. e4 e5
{ The events where the younger generation play with Karpov are fewer these days, but it's interesting to see Karpov show his best form and teach the young "kids" a lesson. }
2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Nc3
{ This has recently been a Shirov specialty. }
5...Nxc3 6. dxc3 Be7
{ Karpov would rather prepare O-O than try to develop Bc8 and Nb8. His Be7 isn't very good, but once developed his two bishops should blossom. }
7. Bf4
{ It's odd to develop the bishop to this square, where it has no immediate prospects. White is aiming to O-O-O. }
7...O-O 8. Qd2 Nd7 9. O-O-O Nc5
{ He's reserving f6 for the dark-square bishop. Karpov is a master of coordination and quiet maneuvering position play. The Nc5 inhibits White from playing Bf1-d3, where it would take aim at Ph7. }
10. Be3
{ He might consider capturing Nc5 in some circumstances, but it appears likely he's repositioning the bishop to d4. It's not desirable to spend an extra tempo for this kind of thing, but the Bf4 just wasn't effective. The Be3 also defends Pf2, so as to meet the threat of ...Nc5-e4 with Qd2-d5. }
10...Be6
{ With this and Nc5 Black has restrained White's Bf1. I could say the position is equal, but there is much creative play to come. With king's castled on opposite sides of the board there are likely to be some pawn advances aimed at poking holes in their enemy's king's pawn shields. }

 ) 12. Nd4 Bd7
{ It might seem he could develop more actively by ...Be6-g4, but White's pawns would simply advance on light squares and chase it back, gaining time for the pawn assault on Kg8. }
13. h4 Re8 14. f3 Bf8 15. g4 Ne6
{ Black has spent five consecutive moves on pieces and hasn't advanced pawns yet. This is unlikely to work. He might be aiming to trade pieces, but that could backfire by bringing White's bishops to even better squares! }

{ I'm baffled by Karpov's pointless maneuver. Now White has cramped both of Black's bishops and has d4 & d3 for his own. This is clearly advantageous for White. }
20...Bd7 21. Bd3 c5 22. Bf4
{ Shirov doesn't get to use d4, but Pd6 (a Benoni-like pawn) is exposed and a bit weak. }
22...b5 23. cxb5 Qb7
{ Pd5 is poison because of Bxh7+, but if Black captures Pb5 he might create some play on the b-file while trading-off White's better attacking pieces (Bd3 for starters) . }
24. Qc2 h6 25. Rg3
{ White is simply going to continue his offensive and get to Kg8 before Black can create any significant threat. }
25...Bxb5 26. g5 Bxd3 27. Qxd3 Rab8 28. Rg2
{ He's left Rd1 to defend Pd5, so there's no chance of an overworked piece causing problems and Rg2 has the added benefit of preventing Re8 from entering the game at e2 or e1. }

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
{ Polgar is one of few top GMs who have stuck with the King's Indian Defense, almost exclusively. }
4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3
{ 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 (Aronin-Taimanov Var.) has been the most popular, but 7. d5 (Petrosian Var.) and 7. Be3 (Gligoric Var.) are also played regularly. Black doesn't want to let Be3 remain so actively placed, where it supports Pd4, so Black usually threatens to capture it by ...Ng4. It's important for Black to force a simplification of some kind in the central pawn formation, so as to know how best to develop the other pieces. }

12. dxe5 fxe5
{ Black sees reason to allow a queen trade; especially when ...g5-g4 might still allow the king-side to open nicely for Black's pieces. The only cost is in leaving d5 to White. }

{ White notices d4 is weak and he hasn't got Be3 or Nf3 to challenge it. }
15. Bg4 Nh8 $1
{ I haven't seen this maneuver since a game of Bobby Fischer's. It's maneuvering toward f4 or h4. It takes time for knights to get to their ideal squares, whereas queens, rooks and bishops can often arrive in just a couple of moves. }

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6
{ Unlike the Dragon Variation the Accelerated Dragon allows White to play c2-c4 (Maroczy Bind) . This gives White a terrific grip on d5 and shortens Black's part of the open c-file. Black's trump is that White won't be castling queen-side and then launching the St. George's attack on the h-file at Black's king. Both sides usually castle king-side and fight it out all over the board. }

Curiously, as in the English Opening game against Shirov, Polgar is using her pawns quite a lot to restrain the opponent.

1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O
{ A key question for White now is how does he intend to use Bc1 and where does he expect the fight to occur. If he wishes to stay within English Opening lines then he might delay a bit with d2-d3, but if he intends e2-e3, Ng1-e2, d2-d4 then that wouldn't do. If he intends e2-e4, d2-d3, Ng1-e2, h2-h3, Bc1-e3, Qd1-d2 then that choice has to be made within the next move or two. If he is interested in switching to a Regular King's Indian Defense with d2-d4 then he could delay a move, but not much longer. It's not the easiest choice to make because Black hasn't already committed his central and queen-side pawns & pieces to any particular formation (a goal of the KID) and Black will usually endeavor to choose the set-up which best challenges whatever White starts with. }

22. b3
{ Keeping up the approach it would seem Black could trade Pa6 for Pb3 and win a pawn ending because of Pc5, but much comes before that ending. Actually Black has to avoid simple trades because they might give White enough room to create some counter-play. Fortunately he has Bf6 to prevent White from occupying a1 with a rook. So, Black piles up on Pb3 and just tries to win in astraight-forward manner. Doubling rooks on the b-file is also likely. }

{ Again, as in several other games of this tournament, Polgar uses another pawn to restrain her opponent's pieces. This one is recognized as fully appropriate for this position.

7...b6 8. Nc3 Bb7
{ What is White's plan? Often it's to play a "normal" way and to let Pc4 participate incidentally. The costs of having Pc4 is that it's impossible to pressure Pa6 with the Bd3 and Qd1-e2 and Bd3 is undefended. }

12...Nbd7
{ This is a well-placed piece to limit White's options. If Pf4 advances then ...Nd7-e5 is terrific. However, if White can create a second threat to go along with f4-f5 then White can still make progress. If White does nothing immediate then Black might consider ...Nd7-c5 to pressure Pe4, but he has to be cognizant of the fact White might use b2-b4 at any moment to chase Nc5 away; so, timing is important. To that end people have often played ...Ra8-c8, ...Qd8-c7-b8-a8 to add more pressure to Pe4. The danger of that is to find Qa8 too far from the king-side to assist in any defensive measures. }
