{In my preparation to this tournament, I (and probably everybody else) paid the most serious attention to two openingsx Ruy Lopez with Bc5 and Najdorf, since most of the participants seem to play them both. Needless to say, refuting Najdorf is tough, but I thought I came close to refuting Ruy Lopez with 5...b5 and 6...Bc5, provided Black responded to 7.a4 with 7...Rb8. But the opening ceremony dealt a heavy blow to mex I was the last one to play Shirov with White. And indeed, in Rounds 7&8 Shirov faced the position after 7.a4 against Kasparov & Anand. But to my relief, he must have thought that these guys know something and replied 7...Bb7. I was still in business.}

{Novelty which, in my opinion, almost kills the entire line. Kasparov, however, seemed to be sceptical. During the closing ceremony he asked me a couple of questions concerning the game, and then remarked that he would do a far better job as White if he was given a chance. It remains a mystery whether his improvement over my play was before or after move 15.

{The game took place at round 7. By that time I had scored 5.5 points and was half a point ahead of my partner. Akesson is known as an uncompromise player, and I myself is ready to add fuel to the fire, so one could expect a hot battle. That was what happened. }

{White shows his aggressive designs from the very beginning. Akesson had never used this lunge, so to some extent it became a surprise for me, but, frankly speaking, rather pleasant one. Let me a little digression to explain to my readers what these feelings are bound up with. 
I studied chess at the Leningrad Pioneers' Palace (subscribers of the "New in Chess" Magazine could feel its atmosphere with the help of the remarkable essay of Genna Sosonko, dedicated to Vladimir Zak ["A great teacher inspires" - see NIC 99/5]). A very experienced master Sergey Khavsky was my coach (by the way, a well-known St.Petersburg grandmaster Vladimir Epishin, living now in Germany, was one of his students). 
Well, master Khavsky inculcated us steadfast disgust for moves like g2-g4 and g7-g5, especially when one makes them at the open position or having a king unprovided for. He often said that "the only case to play g2-g4 is when you win at least a piece". We even invented a special term for such a move - "the anti-Khavsky move". Accordingly, when an opponent resorts to the move, I feel an insuperable desire to "punish" him for this untimely activity and permanently tell myself that "a pawn doesn't advance back" and that "the position weakening must adversaly affect early or late".}

{The match vs. Siberia (Tomsk) was of decisive importance for determination of the Championship's winner.
