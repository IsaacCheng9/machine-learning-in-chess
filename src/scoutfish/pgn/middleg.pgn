{The struggle between a bad bishop outside the pawn chain and a bad bishop
within the chain  While Black's bad Bishop has an open diagaonal at his
disposal, the White bad bishop is condemned to a very passive role. it is
plain that Black's advantage in mobility can be exploited only in the
middlegame. An endgame may well be drawn, since the Bishops control
opposite-coloured squares. It usual to speak of "unlike Bishops", or "Bishops
of opposite colours", although these expressions are not litereally correct. 
 Many players have a holy dread of such bishops, since in an ending it can
happen that an advantage of two or even three pawns may not suffice to force a
win. But before an ending the Gods have placed the middlegame as Dr. Tarrasch
often remarked. And this really is quite logical; the fact that the Bishops
work on opposite colours means that one can never defend what the other
attacks.    Black has attacking chances on the Kingside, and we see that
through the presence of the unlike Bishops the pressure on the White position
steadily increases.} 1... f4 {Prevents the development of the Bishop to e3 and

{Systematic use of the Bishop pair. Steinitz was the first to show a method
for the best utilization of the two Bishops. So far as is know, it was in the
present game that he first applied his system.  The theory of Steinitz applies
to positions which are not close, but which, on the other hand, are not yet
completely open in character. White still has support points at d4 and e5. The
cornerstone of the Steinitz system is to deprive the opponent of such support
points by means of pawn advances. The hostile pieces will thus be doomed to
passivity, and the owner of the bishop pair should not find it difficult to
set a decisive attack in motion. His contemporaries pointed out the weakness
which these pawn advances must necessarily creat. Only through the games of
Steinitz was it realized that such weaknesses are not so serious because two
bishops can cover all the squares, being in this way much more useful for
neutralizing weaknesses than two Knights or Knight and Bishop would be} 1... c5

{The Knights in a closed position  It is evident that in a struggle against
the Bishop pair the two Knights will do best in a closed position such as this
one. Moreover, in this case the presence of the support point at f4 is a
factor which strongly favours the Knights. The practical outcome of such a
position is that White will have to look for a favourable moment to exchange
one of his Bishops for a knight, bringing about a Bishop versus Knight
struggle} 1... Nf7 2. Qf3 Rae8 (2... -- {White has the choice of three schemes:
  1. He can exchange on Bishop at once (Bxf7) and then undertake the fight
with good Bishop (3. Pf3!) against Knight  2. He can exchange the other Bishop
for a Knight as soon as it appears on f4, but then he will have a Bad Bishop
against Knight.  3. he can leave things as they are and keep both Bishops; but
in this case he must work out some way of getting them into action.   Scheme 1

11... Bb5 {Many years after this game was played, Tarrasch used to be accused
of playing too dogmatically; for instance he strongly condemned the playing of
any piece twice in the opening. It is certainly not so in this game, for
rather than complete his development by ... Ne7, he prefers to solely devote
several tempi solely to inducing a weakening of the White pawn structure. It
is curious to think that some twenty-five years later this strategy in the
hands of Reti was to be called new and hypermodern} 12. d3 12... Qa6 $1 13. c4

in such position, for it enables White to start a minority attack on the
Queenside. The present position, however, is an exception which provides us
with a welcome chance of giving a warning against superficial thinking. How is
it that the minority attack give White such a promising initative in many
variations of the QGD? The reason must be that the Pb4-b5 of the minority
attack is a means of breaking the half-open c-file fully open. But this is not
the whole explanation. The essential point is that Black, who has the
half-open e-file, cannot be so prompt with his counterattack. His thematic
advance is ... Pf5-f4, and this need preparation. Preparation however needs
time, and White can use this time to push forward his b-pawn without delay.  
 In light of these considerations the difference between the present diagram
and the normal QG positions, in which the minority attack has legitimate
expectations of success, is clear enough. Black has already played ... Pf5 and
so will probably be able to play ... Pf4 before White can play Pb5 on the
other flank. In short, Black's minority attack gets in first  } 11... exd5 12.

impression that he must lose a piece due to the pin on the Bd4. There is

unnecessary brainracking. In this position, however, there was no need to
resign; on the contrary!  } 1... Bg1 $1 {Black could not only have saved the

After what we have been saying in the last few examples about greed for
material, comment on this move seem superflous, especially as it leads to the
loss of the Black Queen in a few move. Appearance can be deceptive. Lasker is
not just grabbing a pawn. Anyone who really knows his play will realize that
Lasker is choosing this line of of play purposely. Better than any other
player Lasker understood human nature.  After this move Black's position is
very sound. White's material advantage certainly gives him the better chances,
but against this must be weighed the fact that the Queen sacrifice will upset
White's equilibrium. He is sure to think that Lasker has made a bad blunder,

usually anti-positional advance Pf4. This is because he will obtain strong
pressure on the newly opened f-file, whic, in conjunction with the
concentration of his minor pieces on or near the Black Kingside, will provide
enough pressure to compensate for the aforementioned positional liabilities.
In this game Tartakower utilizes these factors well, until a critical moment

forced Black to work hard to achieve a draw. Having missed his chance he winds

{4. BOGOLYUBOV (1889-1953)  Bogolyubov was an attacking player, to be ranked
with Anderssen, Marshall, and Spielmann. With subtle positional play he was
less at home; though in his later years he did operate routinely on positional
grounds while producing many fine endgames. Bogolyubov was an optimist. One of
his famous aphorisms was "When I am White I have the advantage because I am
White; when I am Black I have the advantage because I am Bogolyubov"  His aims,
however, were apt to outrun his capabilities. His great talent was at times
just not great enough, and the occasional gross errors in his play were due to
this disharmony  } 1. e4 {Around 1928 Bogolyubov wrote a book on the d-pawn
opening, under the title 1. d2-d4. However, later in his career he usually

{5. BOTVINNIK (1910-1992)  In some ways Botvinnik was a disciple of Lasker. He
was, like his great forerunner - first of all a great fighter. He revels in
difficult positions; but when necessary he also plays simple positions with
accuracy which is scarecely surpassable. his master stems from the harmony
which exists between his chess technique and his human attributes.  His style
is distinguished by great originality. Ne never minds having his pawn position
shattered, providing that he thereby obtains free play for his pieces.  In
this respect he goes much farther than Tarrasch, who spoke out in favour of
having an isolated d-pawn. Botvinnik was not only unafrad of an isolated
d-pawn; he quite frequently was prepared to accept doubled or even trebled
pawns  Botvinnik not only thirst for battle; as a rule he is thoroughly
prepared for it. Several times he lost matches in defence of the World
Championshpi - first against Smyslov, then against Tal, and then against
Petrosian. In two of these cases - against Smyslov and tal - he had the
opportunity for a return match, and both times he made such thorough
preparations, and directed those preparations so accurately at the weaknesses
of his opponents, that they were no match for him. His skill in the deep and
exhaustive analysis of adjounment positions is scarecely rivaled.  He has
adopted his own particular repertoire of openings, especially with the Black
pieces. Against 1. Pe4 his first choice of defence used to be the French and
then the Sicilian, in keeping with his preference for difficult positions.
Later he often used the Caro-Kann, especially when he needed a solid defence
against the ferocious attacking style of Tal  } 1. d4 Nf6 (1... d5 2. c4 dxc4

{6. BRONSTEIN (Born 1924)  Like Botvinnik, Bronstein is at home in difficult
positions; the difference is that Bronstein will take far greater risks. From
the first move to the last his games are usually struggles in which he devotes
much of his time seeking original, creative lines of play. These are tactics
motivated not only by the idea of forcing his opponent into prolonged thought,
but also by his desire to win as brilliantly as possible.  This style has
something of Alekhine (his pawn sacrifices and his instinct fo breakthrough)
but also something of Tartakower (the best move is not necessarily the
strongest; preference may sometimes be given to a second best move in order to
confuse the opponent)  } 1. d4 ({Porreca-Bronstein, Belgrade 1954

{7. CAPABLANCA (1888-1942)  Capablanca was the possessor of a virtually
perfect technical style, but he was lazy, and had a degree of
self-satisfaction which made him incline towards superficiality. He had little
patience, and was seldom in the mood for hard work. Nevertheless, there was
real inspiration in his ability to forsee possible danger, and in the way he
could nip it in the bud long before it could amount to anything serious. As
might be expected of such a superb technician, he had a particularly fine
feeling for liquidation. All things considered, his was a style which tended
more to defence than aggression.  Capablanca had no faith in principles, but
only in good moves. Since he usually steered clear of trenchant lines of play
he developed primarily into a specialist in the playing of simple positions  }

was given a chance to fully ripen. It is said that as a schoolboy he found
Bilguer's great Handbuch in a public library and copied out the whole thousand
or so pages, memorizing much of it in the process. It is a strange story, but
this Hungarian was a strange figure. His handling of the openins, his feeling
for position and his flair for combination place him in the company of Morphy,
Pillsbury and Alekhine  Although he lived at a time when the gambits offered
fewer chances than had been the case in Morphy's day, he showed a marked
liking for gambit play. Charousek's prime lasted only about two years (1896-97)

{FISCHER (Born 1943)  Usually the style of a chessmaster has to grow; it may
take years before one may speak of any style at all. As a rule the young
player begins with pure combination, and then in the course of time finds that
he must add water to win. He learns the methods of positional play, and
develops endgame technique.  It is quite possible to begin as a combinative
player - a tactician - and yet in maturing to acquire an out-and-out
positional style of play.  The exceptional Grandmaster Fischer, however, is
another and almost unique story in modern chess. At the age of twenty he
already possessed a fully rounded style. He is both tactician and strategist,
an openings expert without peer, and a virtuoso of the endgame.  The following
game against Reshevsky is a good example of his super-class, technical style

{18. KERES (1916-1975)  The Estonian Grandmaster keres was a richly
imaginative player in his youth - but not only in his youth: in his maturity
the same description held good.  The difference is that in his early days his
temperament ran head of his technique, so that sometimes his methods were too
risky and his combinations not sound. in his later years kereds matured into a
complete positional player, while acquiring a perfect knowledgeo f the
openings. Add to this fact that he had reached great heights in the endgame
and we see Keres as the possesor of the ideal style.  Keres himself considered
that combinative play best suited his personality. His great skill in dealing
with complications was developed largely through correspondence play. In his
postal games his one aim was to build up the tension, and he used to steer for
complications right from the start. However, experience taught him that in the
end the accumulation of small advantages pays better than always going for the
attack at all costs.  Our illustration is one of his earliest games  } 1. e4 e6

{19. Em. LASKER (1868-1941)  The style of Emanual Lasker was unique. He had
not quite the creative powers of Alekhine, nor quite such an intense will to
win; but instead he possessed incomparable skill in provoking erros and
remarkable ingenuity in exploiting them. His attentiveness, his powers of
concentration and his tactical prowess were nothing short of miraculous. He
also had very good nerves, evidenced by the fact that he made fewer nervous
slips than almost any other world class player (One of the very few instances
on record was his famous loss to Torre, Moscow 1925)  The layout of his games
was generally quiet and unpretentious. One might describe him as lying in wait;
but he was certainly not passive. His defence was superb.  In the openings he
like to create and maintain tension, and he never shrank from complications.
In the wildest positions he seemd to know better than anyone the best plan of
action, or - an even more difficult matter - which would be relatively best 
 Above all Lasker was a fighter. He probed the weak points in his opponents
amory. Against the positional player he would introduce every tactical
possibility; the combinative experts he would combat by positional means. In
pursuit of these ends eh would take great risks, there are instances on record
which he deliberately chose inferior lines for the sole purpose of getting his
opponent into the sort of position which he would feel ill at ease. Not did
Lasker content himself with seeking loopholes in his opponent's chess
technique: he went so far as to play upon weaknesses in their actual mental
make-up. He knew, for instance, that Janowsky set great store in the two
Bishops, and that he possessed boundless optimism. The combination of these
two factors meant that once Janowsky had the two Bishop he was apt to consider
the game as good as won - a mental attitude from which Lasker profited more
than once  } 1. d4 (1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 Bxb4 5. c3 Ba5 6. O-O

healty ambition with perfect technique. He collected small advantages and knew
well how to turn them to account at the right moment. One could call his style
"cumulative".  He chose quiet openings, was an ingenious defender and a fine

idea of attack - just like those of Anderssen and Spielmann. Marshall was a

common circumstance with "natural" players. Sometimes his insistence on
forcing an attacking position was his downfall. The public found his style
attactive, if a little naive. He knew little about theory, and was weak from
the point of view of technique.  Yet, in spite of all this, his enterprising

{22. MORPHY (1837-1884)  Many people consider Morphy to be the greatest
combinative player of all time. But Morphy owed his remarkable achievements
not only to his admittedly tremendous combinative talents, but also to the
fact that he was the first perfect positional player - in so far as one can
speak of perfection in a human being. Moreover, he had excellent technique. 
 In the maturity of his positional insight, Morphy was half a century ahead of
his time. While other racked their brains for the right procedure, Morphy
simply knew what to do. Unlike his contemporaries who played for complications
on the off chance of finding something, he struck only when the position was
ripe. When he did strike, the blow was hard and often settled the game
outright  } 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 4... Qe7 {At the time when

Morphy always brought every piece into play as quickly as possible. To play

{23. NAJDORF (1910-1997)  The strength of the Argentine grandmaster Najdorf
lies mainly in the middle game and the endgame. He admits he plays the
openings less well than his Grandmaster colleagues. His style is highly
combinative calling to mind the games of Alekhine. He makes snap decisions in
keeping with his mercurial temperament. Positionally he has not reached the
same heights as he has done in the field of tactics. In his early years in
particulary he lacked the compusure and patience which are necessary for
converting small positional advantages into a win.  Najdorf is a fine
simultaneous player and one of the greatest blindfold experts the world has
ever seen - perfhaps the very greatest. The world record he holds - 45
simultaneous blindfold games - will be very difficult to surpass.  Here is
Najdorf's immortal game  } 1. d4 f5 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. Nf3 d5 5. e3 {

{24. NIMZOWITSCH (1887-1935)  As a chess thinker Nimzowitsch is comparable to
Steinitz. If Steinitz was the father of modern chess, Nimzowitsch was the
formulator of the so called hypermodern conceptions.  He was a man of
excellent attributes - very witty, intelligent, a refined type of player with
a slendid flair for all sorts of startling tactical and strategic details. On
the other hand he was a curious individual, inclide to exaggerate and lost
sight of the essentials. he developed his ideas in his books "My System" and
"Chess Praxis". We have already had occasion to elucidate his pioneer work in
the domain of maneuvering and have several times drawn attention to his
doctrine of "over protection"  Likewise in the openings Nimzowitsch made his
mark. There is the Nimzowitsch Defence (1. Pe4 Nc6) and of course the very
popular Nimzo Indian} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qb3 c5 5. dxc5 Nc6 6.

World Championship, several styles converge. In the choice of opening he
preferred hypermodern, stemming from Reti; he like to play openings with
fianchettoed Bishops (Reti's Opening, etc). His positional play reminds one of
Nimzowitsch and Capablanca; and finally his defence is of the mould of
Steinitz  Petrosian build up his games along positional lines. He operated in
a straightforward manner, neither courting complications nor going out of his
way to avoid them. He also brought to his play a phenomenal endgame technique,
great tactical alertness, and patience which is nearly inexhaustiable. For

Alekhine and Marshall. However, Pillsbury was far superior to Marshall in
accuracy and judgement of position: unfortunately, his life was too short to
allow him the experience to reach Alekhine's level. He showed little
inclination to maneuver, but this was natural in view of youth. If his play

young players who attempted to break completely with accepted opinion.
Foremost among them was Reti. Instead of occupying the centre with pawns these
hypermoderns, with Reti as their leader, preferred to control the central
territory by the action of their pieces. They developed their Bishops on the
flanks and held back the centre pawns as long as possible. In his innovations
Reti eventually went too far. He overpressed his theories, as inexperienced
players sometimes do, and was often the victim of practical difficulties  } 1.

occasion demanded. However, in the field of the endgame many consider that his
achievements will never be equalled.  In Rook endings in particular his play
was simply phenomenal. Yet his play also had its deficiencies. Tactially he
was more fallible, as his games agains the great tactician Spielmann showed.

{31. SMYSLOV (Born 1921)  A study of Smylov's games forces one to admit that
it is not easy to say just where his special strenght lies. This Russian
Grandmsater attaches little importance to complex opening variations. He
builds up his games by simple means, and in the middlegame his play is just as
simple and sound. This is not to say that he is averse to combinative play -
there are many excellent examples of beautiful combinative games by Smyslov on
record. But his greatest strength seems to be in the art of making "something
out of nothing". He will maneuver patiently for hours at a time without ever
relaxing for one moment; he seems to be steathily stalking his opponent. There
is indeed something of the assassin about him, for all at once, when least
expected, he will strike. Since moreover his endgame technique is just about
perfect, the smallest advantage in his hands is likely to win  } 1. e4 e5 2.

{32. SPIELMANN (1883-1942)  Spielmann knew his own strength, but also his own
weakness. "I can handle an attacking position just as well as Alekhine", he
said, "but in actual play I cannot often achieve such a position". Spielmann
was indeed a magnificent attacking player. The bravura with which he could
carry an attack through to a brilliant conclusion appealed as much to the
expert as it did to the public.  His main weakness was a lack of opening
knowledge, and this deficiency revealed itself in an inability to build the
kind of position in which he could display his powers. On the other hand it
may also explain the success of this Austrian master against, for instance,
Rubinstein, whose way of building up his game also left something to be
desired.  Spielmann's style calls to mind that of Chigorin. In sheer technique
of combination he outdid the great Russian master, though he was not his equal

{33. STEINITZ (1836-1900)  Steinitz was the first player who really understood
Philidor, and especially Morphy. His games, and even more, his writings
establish him as the father of modern positional play. Things which today are
accepted without question - the occupation of the centre, the strength of the
two Bishops, the theory of weak squares - were revolutionary ideas in the days
of Steinitz.  With all his gifts Steinitz has some definite weaknesses.
Limited powers of combination hampered him in deciding between what was
correct in theory and what was expedient in practise  Steinitz was definitiely
of the materialistic attitude in chess. With intense will power and
scientifice argument he fought against the idea that a material deficit could
be offset by positional advantages which were not in themselves decisive.  He
was a great defender, but he carried his ideas too far, sometimes imposing the
rolde of defender upon himself quite deliberately.   Much of his life's work
was devoted to the demolition of gambits. "The only was to refute a gambit",
said Steinitz, "is to accept it". The dangers he was willing to face in
support of this dogma are shown in the following game  } 1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3.

pounced on his opponents like a tiger; no risk would deter him. His great
tactical gifts and his skill even in severe time pressure enabled him to scale
the heights of Olympus in record time.  Tal, like every other chess master,
had his vulnerbale points. The return match with Botvinnik showed that in
positional play and endgame technique he was no match for the man who both
preceded and followed him as World Champion.  On the other hand it was true

{35. TARRASCH (1862-1934)  Tarrasch continued the work of Steinitz and made it
readily available to everyone. His attitude toward actual play was a more
practical one, if less courageous and perhaps less profound. His style might
be described as "best-quality read made". In his later years he had to meet
all the novel ideas put forawrd by such players as Reti and Breyer, and
suffered many disappointments against younger players.  Through his writings
Tarrasch did more than any man has done to reveal the secrets of good chess to
players in general. The many rules he laid down have put many a moderate
player on the right lines: Don not play Knights to the edge of the board;
occupy the centre with your pawns; constricted positions contain the seeds of
defeat; two Bishops are strong than two knights or Knight and Bishop; in the
endgame the Rook should be placed behind the passed pawn etc. But Tarrasch
proclaimed only the rules, and ignored the many exceptions.  The influence of
Tarrasch is still felt today, and will apparently continue to be. His dislike
for constricted positions was so strong that he would accept a weakening of
his pawn strucutre in preference. In this respect he differed from Steinitz
who had a liking for defending constricted positions  } 1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3.

To give some idea of Tarrasch's style of analysis and clarity with which he
could set out the essentials of the position, we give here his note on this
position:  "Black has far and away the better game. As regards material it is
quite likely in the endgame a Rook and two Bishops will turn out to be
stronger than Rooks and a Knight; furthermore the b-pawn is bound to fall.
Black's centre is very strong, and teh advance of the d-pawn and c-pawn will
produce a pair of united passed pawns. White is still uncastled, and Black can
play to preven Kingside castling by ... Ra8 and ... Ba6. The White Rooks have
not a single open file at their disposal, and the Knight is pinned. In reality
White has only his Queen in play.  It is now up to Black to utilize his
chances tactically. The simplest way thought perhaps not the best, would be ...
Qc5 followed by ... Qxb6 and then advance the c-pawn. Black plays however to
prevent castling, to deprive the opponent of all good moves, to force all his
pieces - especially Knight - to unfavourable positions and finally reduce him

chess and became so thoroughly experienced, his play was perpetually original.

nothing pleased him more than winning a game by means of a little known or

{37. TEICHMANN (1868-1925)  Although Teichmann was generally admitted to be an
outstandingly capable player he seldom achieved the great things that were
expected of him. The explanation was certainly not a lack of talent or of
theoretical knowledge, but almost entirely in a casual attitude towards chess
competition. Teichman was lazy and all to ready to draw, but a mighty man if
he ran into difficulties  } 1. d3 d5 2. Nd2 e5 3. e4 c6 4. Qe2 Bd6 5. f4 {

{38. ZUKERTORT (1842-1888)  Zukertort played thousands of games with the great
Anderssen. This must have been an excellent education in the realms of
combinative play in so far as he needed any educating in the art. Zukertort
was indeed a tremendously talented combination plyaer; morever, he avoided the
common error of his day, which was to play too wildly. From the positional
point of view, however, Zukertort never reached teh same heights. In both his
matches with Steinitz he was consistently outplayed in this sphere. His
failure was in finding of a plan appropriate to this requirements of the
positions. But once on the right plan, he was dangerous even to Steinitz  } 1.
