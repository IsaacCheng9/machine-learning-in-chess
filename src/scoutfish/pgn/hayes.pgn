Bxd6 Qxd6 23. g3 Nd7 {A very excel lent move. Black is not content to merely capture the d5 Pawn. Instead, he wants to reinforce the d3-Knight with Nd7-e5 and then play for an attack against the white King on the weakened light squares. In addition, this sets up a diabolical trap if white tries to recycle his a4-Knight to b2. For example, 24. Nb2 Qf6! 25. Nxd3 Bxd3 26. Qxd3 Ne5! trapping the white Queen. Believe it or not.} 24.

The move is logically designed to prevent black's Knights from going to g4 after white plays the natural f4 to drive away black's Knight on e5. Few better moves spring to mind for white here. 9. Bd3 Nxd3 uncoordinates the white position. 9. Ne2? Nxc4 loses material. Watch how black immediately targets the weakened g3 square.} 9... Nh5 10.

After the natural 11... gxf5 12. f4 Ng6 13. g3 would make black's Knights harmless. White is nearly forced to fork the black pieces in order to develop his own pieces.} 12. g4 Rxf3 13. gxh5 Qf8 {The point of this entire line of sacrifice is made with this move. The white King is stuck in the center. Castling Queenside would run into Bh6 immediately. White finds it difficult to develop his kingside pieces. Black has the initiative with the f-file battery. Therefore, white will find it hard to devise a defensive plan.} 14. Ne4 Bh6 15. Qc2 Qf4 {White can only curse his fortune. White cannot remove black's Rook on f3 because 16. Nxf3 Nxf3+ 17.

1. d4 {C10: French with 3 Nc3: Unusual Black 3rd moves instead of 3...dxe4} 1... e6 2. e4 d5 3. Nc3 c5 {Marshall plays a weak move that will ultimately allow white to shred black's center.  Perhaps black was hoping for tactical chances in the resulting complex position.} 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. exd5 exd5 6. Be2 Nf6 7. O-O Be7 8. Bg5 O-O 9. dxc5 {Black's d-pawn becomes a juicy target; isolated, alone.} 9... Be6 {Black cannot afford the loss of his entire center.  He wastes no time bolstering the weakling.} 10. Nd4 Bxc5 11. Nxe6 {A bad idea by white.  Black reconnects a strong central pair of pawns, opens up the f-file for his Rooks.  White cannot generate counter play against the central pawns in time.} 11... fxe6 12. Bg4 Qd6 13. Bh3 Rae8 14. Qd2 {White should have played a3 to control the important b4 square.} 14... Bb4 {Black immediately pins the poor Knight.} 15. Bxf6 {White deals with black's threat of Nf6-e4.} 15... Rxf6 16. Rad1 {Now white deals with the threat of d5-d4.} 16... Qc5 17. Qe2 {White sets up what he hopes will be a simple exchange of pawns, but Marshall sees more deeply.} 17... Bxc3 18. bxc3 Qxc3 19. Rxd5 {Of course not 19... exd5 because 20. Qxe8 leads to mate.} 19... Nd4 {Black activates his Knight while gaining time on White's Queen.  How should white respond?  The Queen must keep pressure on the e8-Rook.  If 20. Qe5 then 20... Nf3+! 21. gxf3 Rg6+ is crushing.} 20. Qh5? {White loses the upper hand.  20. Qe4 Rf4 21. Qe5 is white's only chance.} 20... Ref8 {With the decisive threat Rxf2.  Black has nothing to gain by 20... exd5?! 21. Qxe8+ Rf8 22. Be6+ Nxe6 23. Qxe6+ Rf7 24. Qxd5 Qxc2 25. f3 =.  20... g6 allows 21. Qe5 =.} 21. Re5 {White may have wanted to play 21. Rc5, but after 21... Rxf2! the game is over.  22. Rxf2 Qe1+ or 22. g3 Nf3+ are both crushing.} 21... Rh6 22. Qg5 {If 22. Qg4? then black would win routinely with 22... Nf3+ discovery on the Rook on e5.} 22... Rxh3 23. Rc5 Qg3 {There you have a move to admire.  The Queen is en prise three ways.  All of which lose.  If 24. hxf3, then 24... Ne2 is mate.  If 24. fxg3, then 24... Ne2+ leads to mate. The game could have continued painfully for white like this:  24. Qxg3 Ne2+ 25. Kh1 Nxg3+ 26. Kg1 Nxf1.} 0-1
