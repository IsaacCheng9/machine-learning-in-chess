{00001.4.4 Analyzed by National Master Corey Russell}
1. e4 Nf6 2. d3 d6 3. Nc3 Nfd7
{A very bad move. In the opening stages of the game, do NOT
move a piece twice without first developing your other pieces,
except to prevent loss of material. In the beginning, there
are 3 elements that are very important: 1) Development --
getting pieces out of their home squares 2) Center control,
and 3) space. Black should've staked some central control
by playing either ...c5 or ...e5.}
4. Be3 e6 5. Nf3
{Because of black's particularly passive play, there's no
reason white should not do 5. f4! right away to gain more
SPACE and central control (e5 square). Notice white plays
f4 later anyways, albeit after a lot of maneuvering.}
5... Be7 6. Qe2 b6 7. O-O-O Bb7 8. Kb1
{There isn't a good reason for this move. Simply 8. d4, staking
claim in the center and opening up the f1-a6 diagonal for the
white's light-squared bishop is more logical.}
8... a6
{Again, black needs to control the center. ...c5! and Nc6!
would give black a fighting chance.}
9. d4 O-O 10. e5
{Good! You're locking up the center to give yourself a free
hand on the king-side.}
10... d5 11. h4 Nc6
{VERY bad. Black needs open lines for his pieces, including
. ...c5! is the natural way to do that, followed by ..Nc6,
...Rc8, and mabe ...cxd4. This would also weaken white's
protection of his e5 pawn once the d4 pawn falls. The general
principle is: Attack the base of pawn chains. For white,
this is e6, and for black it is d4. Note that eventually,
White indeed does attack the base of black's pawn chain,
which was black's fatal error.}
12. g3 h6
{Black should've avoided weakening his king position. Again,
..Na5 and ...c5 was mandatory. White could've taken advantage
of this mistake by playing 13. g4!, followed by h5, Rg1, and
g5 opening up lines on black's king side immediately.}
13. Nh2 Re8
{Black misses many chances to play ...c5, which is his correct
plan.}
14. f4 Na5 15. b3
{This weakens your king position unnecessarily. Since there
is no threat, white can play g4! with a strong attack. For
example, if 15. ... Bxh4 16. Nf3 Be7 17. g5, and white opens
the h-file to fatal effect, because of mate threats involving
Qh2. And if black declines white's pawn, white can simply
play g5, opening up black's king side.}
15... Nb8 16. Qf3 Qd7 17. Bd3 Bb4 18. Bd2 Nbc6
{Of course, ...c5! would be very strong for black. For
example, 18. ... c5 19. Ne2 Bxd2 20. Rxd2 c4 21. bxc4 Nxc4
22. Bxc4 (forced because of the ...Qb5+, Ka1, Qb2 mate
threat) dxc4 23. Qf1 Bxh1 would leave black with a winning
position!}
19. Ne2 Bxd2 20. Rxd2 Rad8 21. f5 Na7 22. f6 N5c6 23. h5
{Good constriction move! White now has a winning position.}
23... Nb5 24. Qg4 g5 25. hxg6 Na3+ 26. Ka1 Nxc2+ 27. Rxc2 Kf8
28. Nf3
{This wins, but the fastest win is 28. g7+ Kg8 29. Qh5, with
the idea of Qxh6 and Qh8 checkmate.}
28... fxg6 29. Qxg6 Re7 30. Rxh6
{Good! Playing only for mate, as the rook on e7 is irrelevant.
The pawn on f6 is very dangerous to black's king position.}
30... Rh7 31. Rxh7 Qxh7 32. Qxh7 a5 33. Qh8+ Kf7 34. Ng5#

and forces black to resign.}
42... g5 43. c4 Rd4 44. Rd2 Rxd3 45. Rxd3 Kxd3
{So in conclusion, always look at what your opponent's last
move was -- what is their idea? Are they threatening anything?
Also, try to place your pieces in the best places. To ccompare
where good posts are, just compare how many moves your piece
would have at the various squares. Whichever gives your piece
the most mobility, is the best square. NOTE: You will have to
balance good placement with the piece's safety. If pawns can
push your piece around, then that's not a very good square
either. Otherwise, you did fairly well with the resources
you had available.}

{This game illustrates one very important principle: Do NOT
move pieces (Knights, Bishops, Rooks, Queen) more than once
in the beginning stages of the game! Remember, you have an
army -- get all your soldiers in battle, don't just send one
guy by himself!}
4. Qe2
{? Not good...Queens should not be moved early. This move
blocks white's bishop from getting out. Instead, 4 Bd3 is
a much better move. Remember to develop with attack if possible.}
4... f5 5. Ne5
{? Again, do NOT move pieces more than once early. Black
only has one good piece. White should develop a piece and
try to get rid of black's good knight. 5 Nbd2 would be a
good way to do this.}

 ...Qf6 is mandatory to meet White's threat.}
6. Qh5+

than once early -- to procure LARGE amounts of material.}
6... g6 7. Qe2
{White misses his chance. The black h-pawn was pinned --
so white could've played 7. Nxg6!, and if 7. ... hxg6 then
8. Qxh8, and white is ahead a Rook and Pawn vs. knight.
Black's best defense is 7. ... Nf6 8. Qh3 Rg8.}

by Bg2 are all preferable to 8. Nc4.}

best piece by f3?}
15... fxg4
{The general rule of thumb is: when choosing which pawn to
capture, capture toward the Center. ..hxg4 would not only
keep the f5 pawn defending black's knight, it would another
pawn after ...Rxh4.}

White has to play Rff2, and ...Bxf2 is checkmate because
the rook on e2 is not allowed to recapture (that would expose
white's king to the black queen on e3).}
33. Rd2 g2+ 34. Ke2 Rf8

this lack of post for thie bishop could've meant a loss for
black.}

{Remember: Using ALL of your chessmen is always more effective.
White could've played the correct O-O, and after Rad1, Rfe1,
ALL of his pieces would be active, while black has a hemmed

save his game, despite being a pawn minus. Instead white
gives up his b-pawn for free.}
15... Qxb2 16. O-O Be7
{Good. This preserves the bishop pair. Bishops control more
squares on an open board. You could check this for yourself.
Put 2 knights on an empty board in the center, and they can go

and they can go to 26 squares!}
17. g4 f5 18. gxf5 exf5 19. Rab1 Qe5 20. N4g3 g6
{Better is 20. ... f4, because this would deny white a square
for his Knight at f4, in addition open up the h3-c8 diagonal
for black's bishop. With the text, white can play 21. Nf4 Qf6
22. Re1 g5 23. Ng6! Qxg6 24. Rxe7, with chances for white to

the center. When getting your pieces out, develop toward
the center (the squares e4, d4, e5, d5 are known as the center).}
2. Rh3
{?! Extremely dubious. The rook is vulnerable to attack,
this move does not control the center, and this weakens
white's kingside. Pawn to d4 makes more sense.}
2... h5
{Much stronger is 2 ... d5. This gets a foothold in the
center, opens up a line for your bishop on c8, and to boot
forces white to move one of his pieces again, since the
Rook on h3 is threatened by black's bishop. Notice too,
that now the g5 square is open for white's pieces, since
now your h-pawn can't cover it.}
3. e3 d5 4. Bb5+ c6 5. Ba4 b5 6. Bb3 Qd6
{Since a rook is worth more than a bishop (rook = 5 pawns,
bishop = 3 pawns), better is to take the free material

difference of having a rook instead of a bishop is winning.}
7. Nc3 a5 8. Nf3 a4

If you see a good move, stop: there might be an even better move.}
9. Rg3 axb3 10. cxb3 Bf5 11. Rg5 Rh6
{This overlooks white's threat. A handy thing to remember is:
why did my opponent make that move? You probably would've
seen that he was threatening your bishop.}
12. Rxf5 Rg6 13. Ne5 Qe6
{There's a principle in chess that says, "Avoid moving queens
early". This is no exception. In addition, White's knight
was threatening to capture black's rook. Why not win a pawn
and get your rook out of jeapardy with ...Rxg2?}
14. e4 Rxg2 15. Ne2 dxe4
{...Nxe4 wins immediately. Black would be threatening white's
Rook, Knight, and once white's rook moves, even ...Nxf2 is
in the air.}
16. Nd4 Qd5
{This was good retort on your part. You save your queen,
and stay in the center. As it happens, black can win a
knight by playing 16. ... Rg1+ 17. Ke2 (forced) Rxd1
18 Nxe6 fxe6 19. Kxd1 exf5. You'll start seeing these
combinations with practice.}
17. Nexc6 Qd6

for the free queen! However, the bishop has a good post

23. Kf3 Ng5+ 24. Kxf2

than losing the bishop for the pawn.}

30. Qg4 (threatening Rxg5, discovered check!) Ke7 31. Raf1,

one of his/her draws or losses. It can be humbling at times,
and even difficult, but by going over a loss, trying to find
out what went wrong, and how to improve, will reap great results.
I myself did the same when I was a youth, and by continually
going over games that I lost/drew, I found out what I did wrong,
and resolved not to repeat them. I did go over wins as well
to look for improvements, but rarely did I learn as much.
BTW, I have a feeling that if the computer gives you a free

from your mistakes! Keep up the good fight.}

{All right! Courage! You will learn more from your
losses than you will from your wins. If you study the
games you lose you will see the patterns that get you
in trouble and common mistakes you make. If you
minimize these then you will improve quickly. A good
source for this study might be Soltis' "Catalogue of
Chess Mistakes."}
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 d6
{Your move is a tad unusual but it works. Typically
the King's Bishop often finds its way to c4.
Traditionally the idea is to play 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4
first.}
4.O-O Be6
{Your opponent errs. The one thing you must be aware
of in the Opening is to grab any and all chances to
wreck your opponents pawn structure. Look at 5. Bxe6
fxe6 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Nf6 9. f4. This
may be my personality but I feel Black has serious
problems organizing anything useful with the shattered
pawn structure. The only redeeming quality is that
Black as three center pawns.}
5.d3 Bxc4 6.dxc4 Nf6 7.Re1 g6 8.Bf4 Bg7
{Remember to play with a plan! The last few moves are
setting up a nice attack but do you understand what
you are trying? Often we hear the mantra to develop,
so we develop and miss the point behind why we are
making the move. The idea of the opening is to create
an "imbalance" [any difference in the position] -
especially in minor piece position - and develop
around it. One idea of developing the Bishop to f4 is
to play h3 to give the Bishop a safe haven while
keeping the Knight at bay. BTW the pawns at e4 and c4
are considered a strong strategy against the
Sicilian.}
9.Nc3 O-O 10.Rb1 Ng4
{Here you have to look at playing 10. Qd2 with the
idea of playing Bh6 to rid the game of the Dragon
Bishop. Also tempting is to blast the center with 10.
e5!}
11.Nd5 Qa5
{It always helps when your opponent misses a solid
move. ...Nge5}
12.h3 Nf6 13.e5 Nh5
{It looks like your move loses a pawn but it is a
gutsy idea. The aggressiveness of your play will help
you as you learn the various tactical possibilities of
a position. One suggestion is to concentrate on
pattern recognition. Learn the various patterns
behind combinations. There are probably only about 20
common ones.}
14.Bg5 Qxa2
{Ouch. Black begs White to finish the game in a clean
stroke. There is an "urban legend" that tells of a
rich guy that left his son a vast fortune on the
condition that he would never play Qxa2 even if it
were the correct move. 14...dxe4 or 14...f6 was necessary
to hold the balance.}
15.Nxe7+ Nxe7 16.Bxe7 Rfc8 17.b3 dxe5
{I find in my lost games that I generally had a "big
miss." Well, this one is yours. After 17. exd6 the
game is over, you can hear the "fat lady warming up."
The pawn on d6 moves to d7 and completely chokes
Black's middle. The Black Rooks become totally
useless and you own all the important squares. All
this is helped by the useless placement of the Black
Queen. Even 17. Ng5 does close to mortal damage to
Black threatening both 18. exd6 and 18. Qd5.}
18.Nxe5 Nf4 19.Re4 Re8
{Please, do not help your opponent! Remember, never
force your opponent to do something you will regret.
19. Qc1! Attacks the Knight on f4, if that is what you
want, and holds the back line down nicely. One thing
you must learn is when a threat is real and when it is
not. The ideal is to ignore your opponent's threats
and execute your own. To do this you must learn to
distinguish between the real and the imagined.}
20.Nd3 Nxd3 21.Re2 Nf4
{21. cxd3 was necessary. It is ugly but playable.
It's better than what happened. White is saddled with
two "backward" pawns - on d3 and on b3. I'd call this
a positional nightmare, but against a weak opponent
you will have an interesting fight on your hands. The
squares in front of them are called "holes" where
Black will plant a piece. This is called a
"blockade." The strength of a blockade is that the
pawn is immobile. In chess, if it doesn't [or can't]
move it will suffer violence. Keep your position as
flexible as possible while coaxing your opponent into
making his as ridged as possible. Another strength of
the blockade is that it is a base of operation against
the opponent. The blockader can not be attacked
through the weak pawn.}
22.Re1 b6 23.Bg5 Rxe1+
{23. Qf3 or 23. Rc1. Your idea of chasing the Knight
with the Bishop is misguided and at this point fatal.
Don't attack something for the sake of attacking.
Always ask yourself, "what is my opponent
threatening?" "If I move this what can my opponent
threaten or take?" You must have a solid positional
reason to attack. Generally if it is mobile, look
somewhere else unless you are attempting to create a
weakness such as immobility or a poorly defended
piece. As much as possible "over protect" everything
[pieces and important squares]. By creating an
interlocking web of pieces you will make them "all"
mobile [perfect for attack or defense]. Think
"internet." Anything that "inters" it doesn't leave
with all its body parts.}

move your Q to b1 instead of moving the pawns. I
suspect when you start moving pawns you are out of
plans. Suggestions for improvement: Keep up the
slash and attack style. Be a threat to everyone you
meet. Put some effort into learning pawn play.
"Pawns are the soul of chess." Most plans revolve
around the pawn structure. If you get this down you
will become difficult for the "sharks" [2000+ players]
to handle. Don't give away pieces! Don't force your
opponent to do anything you will regret. Don't panic
- if you find yourself tempted to move pawns sit on
your hands and breath [that's when you inhale and
exhale air from your lungs - I often forget in a tense
game] then look for a logical line that the position
demands. Keep examining your lost games, your courage
will take you far! [I read that on a "Chinese
fortune" cookie once - grin.] Develop an attitude: If
my opponent can beat me they will have to do it
without my help!}

{This position is known as the Center Counter, or Scandinavian
defense. While objectively sound for black, I don't recommend
 it as this early queen sortie, as it doesn't help black's
central control much, plus black always has to be careful
where he moves his queen again, as the monarch is always
pushed around by White with an eventual Nc3 or c4. If black
isn't careful, he could lose his queen easily, as this game
demonstrates.}
3. d4 Nc6

same time puts pressure on White by threatening to capture on d4.}

White's center. For example, if ...Bg4 5. c4?? Qe4+ 6. Be2 Bxf3
7. gxf3 Qxd4 leaves black up a pawn! This is one reason why
it's common for white to boot black's queen from the center

white gets a free hand to push black around.}

a tempo.}
11. Qxf3 b5

slightly weaker. Why not solidfy central control with ...c6,
Re8, with a ...d5 expansion? Remember, when ahead in material,

{As a result of this interchange, white has 3 pawn islands,
black has 2. A pawn island is a group of pawns separated

each other).}

definite edge for black.}
16. Rd3 Qb8
{...Qa8! (pressuring white's e-pawn again) is quite strong...

Because it's centralized! I can't emphasize the importance
of this enough.}

Instead Qd2 is stronger. This would prevent blacks' queen

e5 break by black (because the black d-pawn would be hit by
white's queen and bishop. Also, ...Bg4, followed by ...Bxf3,

{? Now black mobilizes his pawns, white's bishop is bad,

undoubling black's pawns for him. Because of the opposite
colored bishops, white could put a much stiffer reistance
by playing 21. Qd3 Rfc8 22. Rcd1!, and black has no access
points (c2 is covered by the light squared bishop), and no
way to boot white's bishop. Note that even if black sac'd
his rook on c4 at some point, white doesn't even have to
take it! Also, the d-line pressure would discourage a ...e5

The reason strong players avoid weakening their squares if
possible is to deny good outposts/lines for the opponent's

{So in conclusion, don't give up pieces for pawns except
for VERY good reasons (like forced checkmate). Also,
when in doubt in what to move, improve your worst pieces.
Masters do this themselves when a plan isn't obvious.
In addition, try to concentrate your heavy pieces
(rooks & queen) on open files (columns)...they are most
effective in that setup. Try to look at forced moves,
and try ask yourself, "Why did my opponent move there?".
If you ask yourself that question, often you can see that
he was trying to threaten your pawns/pieces or checkmate,
and if you see his threat, you can parry it.}

1. Nf3 Nf6 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. d4 d5 4. e4
{This loses a pawn. Correct is continuing development
with 4. Bg5.}
4... dxe4 5. d5 exf3 6. dxc6 fxg2
{Black misses his chance to get a very strong position with
6. ... Qxd1+ 7. Kxd1 Bg4!. This threatens 8. ... fxg2
discovered check, followed by 9. ... gxh1(Q). Notice that
if white tried 7. cxb7, then 7. ... fxg2+ 8. Ke1 gxh1(Q)
9. bxa8(Q) Qxa8 would leave black up a lot of material.
The move black chooses just develops white's bishop.}
7. Bxg2 Qxd1+ 8. Kxd1 Bf5 9. cxb7
{Yes! The correct move. This passed pawn is very strong,
and should have decided the game.}
9... Rd8+ 10. Bd2
{Good! Respond to threats by developing pieces. Best chances
that way.}
10... e5 11. Re1
{Correct. If possible develop with attack, like this move
does.}
11... Bd6 12. Bc6+ Bd7 13. Bf3 O-O 14. Ne4 Bg4
{?? Loses a piece by force. Black's position was difficult,
he had to figure out a way to get rid of White's thorn in
his side at b7. Otherwise, he might as well resign right
now.}
15. Nxf6+ gxf6 16. Bxg4 Bb4 17. Re2
{Too passive. Much stronger is 17. c3 Bc5 18. Bc8, forcing
black to sacrifice his rook because of white's threat of
b8(Q), and after exchanges on c8, would leave white up a
full rook!}
17... Bxd2 18. Rxd2 Rxd2+ 19. Kxd2 Rd8+ 20. Ke1
{No. Now that most pieces are exchanged, the king is a
fighting piece -- the threat of mate is non-existent.
White should try to support his passed b-pawn with 20. Kc3.}
20... Rb8 21. Bf3
{This works, but 21. Bc8! Kf8 22. Rd1 would leave black in
a complete bind. Black would be helpless to stop white's
plan of advancing her queen-side pawns, and forcing a
breakthrough on b6.}
21... f5 22. Rd1
{? Not the best. Let's take a look here. What are the key
elements of this position? Elements of chess are king safety,
material imbalances, space, development, for example. In
this case, the key facts are: 1) White has an extra bishop,
and 2) the passed, PROTECTED pawn on b7. The b7 pawn has
the most potential, and should have been preserved if at
all possible. In this case it was, by playing Bc6 instead.
Then the plan of 23. Rd1, Rd7, Rxc7, followed by Rc8 is
winning outright.}
22... e4 23. Bg2 Rxb7 24. f3
{Not the best. The general rule of thumb when up a piece
is in endgame is: Trade pieces, NOT pawns. Conversely,
if someone is losing, they should trade pawns, not pieces.
Correct was to preserve white's b-pawn with 24. b3. The
text makes it more difficult for white to win.}
24... exf3 25. Bxf3 Rxb2 26. Rd8+ Kg7 27. Kd1
{Again, now that mate threats are minimal, aggressive use
of the king is called for. White should advance toward
the center with Kd2.}
27... Rxa2 28. Bd5 Ra3 29. Rd7 c5 30. Rxf7+ Kg6 31. Rc7 Ra5
32. Bg8
{?! Dubious. White's bishop was already well placed on d5.
More logical was to get white's king involved in the action
with Ke2.}
32... h6 33. Bh7+ Kg5 34. Rf7 f4 35. Ke1
{Unnecessarily passive. Ke2 is still best.}
35... c4 36. Kf2 a6 37. Kg2
{Actually, 37. Rg7+ Kh5 38. Kf3 would win material for white,
plus bottle up black's king. A mating net might even be
possible. Otherwise, black's only choice would be 37. ... Kf6,
but that loses the h6 pawn to Rg6+. That would present
problems for black since that would create a passed pawn
(a passed pawn means unopposed by enemy pawns).}
37... Kh4 38. Rxf4+ Kg5 39. Kg3
{There was a free pawn on c4. There was no reason not to
take it.}
39... Ra2 40. Rg4+ Kf6 41. Rxc4 Ra3+ 42. Bd3 h5 43. Kh4 Ra1
44. Rc6+ Ke5 45. Rxa6 Rh1 46. Kh3 Kf4 47. Rf6+ Kg5 48. Be4
{Actually 48. Rf5+ Kh6 (...Kg6? 49. Rf1+ picks up black's rook)
Be2 would pick up black's last pawn, and probably make black
resign.}
48... Re1 49. Re6 Re2 50. Re5+
{Never give check just to give check! Only do it for a good
reason. Correct is 50. c4 (passed pawns must be pushed!)
The black king cannot get at white's rook, and can't win
the bishop on e4 since white can always preserve her bishop
with Bd5, which also protects her rook on e6.}
50... Kf4 51. Rxh5 Rxe4
{Black makes an inaccuracy here. Now white can win by force.
...Kxe4 would give black some chances to draw.}
52. Rh4+ Ke5 53. c3
{Simply exchanging rooks followed by Kg4 would win easily
for white. Black could have played
...Rd3+ leaving white only a pawn up.}
53... Rxh4+ 54. Kxh4 Kd5 55. Kg3
{This works, but generally this is the wrong move. In king
and pawn endgames, the rule of thumb is: Advance the king
as much as is possible to support a pawn advance, without
jeopardizing the pawn's safety. Therefore, 55. Kg5 was
the correct move. If white's c-pawn were gone, black could
draw by running his king to h8, and white would unable to
make progress. With Kg5, however, white can get to g7 first,
blocking black's king, and forcing white's h-pawn to queen.}
55... Kc4 56. h4 Kxc3 57. h5 Kd4 58. h6 Ke5 59. h7 Kf6
60. h8=Q+ Kg6 61. Kh4 Kf7 62. Qe5 Kg6 63. Qe8+ Kg7
64. Kg5 Kh7 65. Qg6+
{Inaccurate. 65. Qe7+ Kh8 66. Kg6 Kg8 67. Qg7#. When
checkmating a lone king with a queen + king, you always
want to leave a legal move for the enemy king until it's
checkmate. If you don't, then black can escape with a
draw by stalemate, which is exactly what happened in this
game.}
65... Kh8 66. Kh6
{So in conclusion, watch out for your opponent's threats,
and if you have passed pawns on the 7th rank (row), do all
you can to protect them. They can often decide games if
they can queen, because they will force more valuable pieces
to sac themselves to stop it. Also, in endgames, use your
king to support your passed pawns, and to limit the activity
of your opponent's king.}

1. d4
{Personally, I don't recommend my students playing 1.d4
until they are about class "A" strength. 1.d4 very often
leads to strategic play, and 1.e4 is often direct and tactical.
The problem is, there are more strategical concepts than
tactical in chess, so 1.d4 is harder to play well. I know
some players avoid 1.e4 because of the theory involved, but
once you understand positions resulting of 1.e4, it really
does help understanding 1.d4. This was true for myself.}
1... d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3
{Already a strategical miscue happens. Because of black's
inaccurate move 2, white can get nice central control and
space with 3. cxd5 Nxd5 4. e4 Nb6 5. Nf3. The pawns on d4
and e4 are called the "ideal" pawn center.}
3... e6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. g3
{Unfortunately, this is one of those positions where the
fianchetto of the bishop isn't very effective. White's
bishop is blocked by the black d-pawn, and there is no way
to dislodge it except by an eventual e4. But if white does
that, then white will be obliged to recapture with a piece,
and this leaves white's d-pawn isolated. See all the strategical
concepts I was talking about? In this position, much more
promising is quick development with 5. Bg5, then a later e3,
Bd3, Nf3, etc. The text should give black a nice game.}
5... Bb4 6. Bd2
{Unnecessarily passive. Quick king-side castling is white's
best chance for an advantage. Therefore 6. Bg2 is the best
chance. 6. ... Ne4 is not really a threat, because 7. Qb3
defends against the threat and counter-attacks. This kind
of defense-counterattack tactic is fairly common in 1.e4.}
6... Bxc3
{Black shouldn't have released the pressure. Simply O-O is
logical and strong. Black could then follow it up with ...Re8,
...c6, ...Bf5, ...Nbd7, with a nice game because of the clamp
on the central e4 square. Only if white wastes a tempo with
a3 should black capture the knight at c3.}
7. Bxc3 Ne4 8. Bg2 Nxc3 9. bxc3 Be6 10. e4
{?! Definitely dubious. White is opening up the center before
he's completed development. Luckily for white, black didn't
play the most active line.}
10... dxe4 11. Bxe4 c6
{Stops white threat on b7, but much more interesting was
11. ... O-O!? 12 Bxb7 Bd5! 13. Bxa8 Re8+ 14. Ne2 Bxa8, with
a clear advantage for black! Note that if white tries
15. O-O, then white will be extremely weak on the light
squares. Otherwise, 15. Rg1?? loses to 15. ... Bf3. This
line just illustrates the dangers of opening up the center
too early.}
12. Ne2 Nd7 13. Bg2 Nf6 14. Nf4
{Not good. 14. ... Bc4! would pose white some tough problems
...this would prevent white from castling, and threatens ...O-O

{This is definitely not the best move. 4. dxe5 dxe5 5. Qxd8+ Kxd8
6. Nxe5 wins a pawn with a great game for white. Among masters,
this is usually winning. The text move, however, doesn't develop
a piece, weakens white's kingside, and even concedes the g4
square to black. I honestly can't see how this helps white.
Piece development is critical...generally white would want to
get his bishop out, his queen knight out, castle short, and
basically get all white's pieces into the center to try to
overwhelm black.}

when white's king is still uncastled, plus gives the d5 square
to use for black's pieces. At this point, white probably had
to console himself with 15. a3 Nc6 16 Qxb7, though black is
certainly still better.}
15... dxe5 16. Bxe5 O-O 17. Rh5

repair his position.}

19. Ne4 Nbd5 20. Be2 Rb6 21. Bb5
{Stepping into pins (now the rook on b6 pins the bishop on b5)
is rarely good, and this is no exception. Black could have
played 21 ... c6 and pretty much have forced white to resign.
Notice that 22. Nxf6+ Nxf6 doesn't go anywhere, since the bishop
on e5 would then be pinned.}

{The idea of the opening is to create an imbalance and
develop around it.
White needs to capitalize on
Black's dark square weakness and launch a Kingside
attack. Black on the other hand must keep things
"active" on the Queenside. Key to this will be
Black's King Bishop.}
6. Bg5 Be7
{6. e5 is tempting. To play this move White must
answer two questions: 1.) Can I survive the attack
on the a8 - h1 diagonal? 2.) Can I maintain the pawn
on e5? If there is doubt to either of these questions
then the move should not be played. Black's game
strategy is based on "baiting." The idea of "baiting"
is to set a trap. This game strategy is unsound since
it is based on what the player wants to do and not the
demands of the position. Still a misstep could be
lethal. Unfortunately the constant "baiting" will
eventually turn a winning position into a completely
lost game. White carefully side-steps most of the
pitfalls.}

9. f4 Black will also have the e4 square for a solid
post for the King Knight.}
12. Nce2 Nxe4 13. Bxe7 Qxe7 14. Qd3 d5 15. c3 bxc3
{Black can also try ...Qc5 and ...Nd7. Personally ...Qc5 is
tempting. White wisely plays to exchange of the
Knight on e4. Another way to do this is to play Ng3.}
16. Nxc3 Qd8
{One of my High School students stated that Black's
move is "pointless." Stronger is ...Qb4 or ...Nd7.}
17. Nxe4 dxe4 18. Qxe4 0-0
{Again Black is "baiting" White to play 19. Qxa8 Qxd4
when the White position begins to fall to pieces.
Trading positional considerations for material is
risky if you do not know what you are doing. Avoiding
the "bait" is wise. Remember when you opponent plays
this type of game, you are sure a major error will
happen in their game. The question is distinguishing
the error from the "bait."}
19. 0-0 Nd7 20. Nc6 Qb6+ 21. Rf2 Nf6
{White plays an excellent move. It is flexible in the
sense that it contributes to stacking the Rooks on the
file of your choice.}
22. Qf3 Rac8
{Black simply blunders. 23. Ne7+ picks up the
exchange.}
23. Rc1 Rc7
{Black immediately blunders again! 23....Nd5 wins the
Knight on c6 or the Rook on c1. If White chooses to
complicate the issue then 24. Qxd5 exd5 25. Ne7+ Kh8
 26. Nxc8 Qe6. The passed d-pawn and the trapped
Knight make life interesting for White.}
24. Kh1 Nd5 25. Rfc2 Rfc8
{...h6 still holds, barely}
26. Ne7+ Kh8
{Black misses a chance at a nice "bating" idea. 26....
Nxe7 27. Rxc7 Qxc7 28. Rxc7 Rxc7. The idea is to
"bait" 29. Qa8+ Rc8. Thus White must give up the
Queen or submit to checkmate.}
27. Nxc8 Qxb2
{Another attempt at a "bating" maneuver. Actually
27.... Rxc2 is better, but black is lost. All that
remains is the quickest way to finish off Black.}
28. Rxc7 Nxc7 29. Qd1 Nd5
{29. Qc6! finishes the game quicker.}
30. Rc2 Qb7 31. Nd6 Qd7 32. Rc8+
{Ideas for White's improvement: There seems to be a
good feel for traps. However the strongest
continuations were not chosen. Study in pattern
recognition would be useful to see ideas
"automatically." Work on the concept of "imbalances"
more. The idea of planting the Knight on c6 was a
good example of attempting to gain the superior minor
piece. In a sense this made the difference in the
game. Even though both players generally mishandled
it, it was enough to gain the victory. White needs to
consider the possibilities along the diagonals before
moving. Being "diagonally challenged" will lose many
games. Examples of this weakness: Allowing Black the
opportunity to launch a Queen side attack with b4,
missing the Black win of the Knight on c6 by cutting
off the diagonal, missing the final nail of Qc6. Over
all it was a good recovery from a bad position and
good avoidance of the various "bait" that was offered.
 It takes a certain maturity to not grab material.}

{There are different types of mistakes a player can
make. This is a "psychological" mistake (different
than the "concrete" mistake). Since White opened with
the Queen's Pawn, this allows Black to force the game
into King's Pawn lines. Principle: In the Opening
you choose the pawn structure - not your opponent.}
3. Nc3 Nf6
{White invites the Winawer Variation (3. ...Bb4). Black
however opts for the Classical Variation. Gligoric
commented that "Black can not avoid concrete
variations which tend to favor White." Short called
this line the "Boring Variation" and wrote, "This
variation is suitable for people with masochistic
urges."}
4. e5 Nfd7
{Probably best is 4. Bg5 (pinning the Knight and
forcing Black to respond). Principle: seize the
initiative.}
5. Nf3 c5
{Before playing this move White should try Qg4. Here
is the wages of being lead down your opponent's path.
The last two moves, White missed the most aggressive
idea.}

{9. Re1 is pointless. White missed Ne2 with the idea
of c3. This would ensure a permanent (possibly
winning) advantage in pawn structure. At this point
9.... cxd4 is stronger. However, Black's pawn structure
resembles a strong Queenside attack.}
10. Be3 Qb6 11. b3 cxd4
{With the last two moves White transforms a playable
position into one that is almost completely lost. An
idea for move 10 is a4. However b3 is utterly bad.
The c-pawn is permanently weak and probably
undefendable. The "hole" created on c3 will be the
can opener to pry White's position open. At this
point White can probably resign. White has no
credible attacking possibilities. The only redeeming
quality is that Black is playing a "virtual" piece
down (the bad Bishop). Principle: do not weaken your
position with pawn moves.}
12. Nxd4 Qa5
{A good move but not a game winner. Black aims at the
hole on c3 and control of the c-file with the Queen
Rook. Control open lines (files and diagonals)!}
13. Nxc6 Qxc3 14. Nd4 Rc8 15. Bg5 h6
{White's wounds are self-inflicted. The Bishops
presence in the center was critical. Black should
consider the immediate ...Bc5. Principle: always play
in the center, if possible! An idea for White could
be Qg4. Notice that the Queen at g4 still operates in
the center.}
16. Bh4 Qb4 17. a3 Qc5
{Black misses the simple ...Bc5.}
18. Qd3 Qc3
{White can still make life interesting with 18. b4.
Black is offering an interesting idea that is
consistent with the over all game plan. The idea is
to encourage White to err.}
19. Qxc3 Rxc3
{With the exchange of Queens, White gives up the
c-file, the Queenside and the game.}
20. a4 b4
{White's move is terrible. Principle: do not attack
when you have no positional justification! Black lets
White off the hook by missing 20.... bxa4!; completely

his king-side pawn majority, so he should've looked for a
way to mobilize them. The way to do that was 33. Rf5+ Ke7
34. g5, which would make it a lot harder for black. Notice
black couldn't even have tried 34. ... Rf8? in that variation,
because white's pawns are too fast. e.g., 34. ... Rf8
35. g6! Rxf5 36. gxh7 Rf8 37. Ng6+ Kf7 38. Nxf8, and black

37. Kd1 Kg6 38. Nf4+ Kf5 39. Nh3 Kg4
{This is winning for black, but because of low time, both
players agreed to a draw. So in conclusion, get your pieces
developed in the early stages. Also, when calculating
variations, see what you get vs. your opponents, to see
if you could win material. Early in the game, black could
have gotten Q & B, while white would get black's queen.
Only by using all your forces will you have good chances

of your TIME and moves. Second idea: count the number
of squares the Knight can move to on f3 (eight), now
count the number of squares it can move to on h4

unable to boot a white piece from e5. He will have to use

{I understand your wish to post a knight on c5, but this

It is a hole in your opponent's position. A hole is a square
that your opponent's pawns can't cover. c5, on the other
hand, can easily be covered by the black b-pawn. Instead
of Bg5, I recommend the following setup to take advantage
of black's weakening by f5: Nc3, Bc4, Nf3, castles short
(O-O), and Re1, with a definite advantage to white because b
lack's e6 pawn is a target.}

if you opponent uses all of his pieces, kind of like a 3 on
1 fast break in basketball. Instead, Be2 looks best, so that
if black tries to push ...e5, white won't have to worry about
a discovered check, because the bishop would be blocking.
After the text, black could win a pawn by playing 8. ... Qxc5
9. dxc6 Qxc6.}

prevent the loss of a piece. Qe2! does the job! Black can't
take the knight since that would expose his king to check by
the white queen on e2, which is illegal. White only loses a
pawn this way. Also, the knight on e2 block's white's bishop
from getting out. This will cause problems later. White's
king-knight should be posted on f3 instead, where it helps to
control the center.}

and his king is in check. Is there any move that will get the

that, it even indirectly defends white's knight at c5, since
the black queen is pinned to her king. Instead, black procures
a large amount of material.}

Caro-Kann Defense}
1. e4 c6 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 d5
4. Ne5 Nf6 5. f4 Bc5
{Both sides have mishandled the Opening. Black misses
the golden opportunity to cramp White "almost"
permanently with ...d4. From now on White has to play
"catch up." In some fine restaurants putting
"ketchup" on your steak means the cook did a poor job.
 In chess playing "catch up" in the Opening,
especially as White, means you've done a poor job.
The move, 5. f4 is "almost" losing. After 5...d4 the
Knight has to move. The idea for Black is Nxe4, Bd6,
and Qc7. This game of "ketchup" should be fatal for
White.}
6. d4 Bd6
{White gets back on track. While the move 6. d4 is
not the best, it is an attempt to put some pressure on
the Black center and keep disaster a move or so
further down the line. It stuffs the Black idea of
...d4. 6. Nd3 is an odd move that seems to work.
This strange move attacks the Bishop and keeps it off
b4 at the same time! The problem is that it is a "one
move" solution that blocks the Bishop and will
probably have to move again. The idea is to find as
permanent solutions as possible in the opening. Black
now as the golden opportunity to play 6...Bb4 completely
disrupting the White center.}
7. Bd3 O-O
{White misses the simple, and possibly equalizing,
idea of 7. Nxf7! Kxf7 8. e5. Always consider the
check. A check is a free move. How many times would
you like to move more than once? Here is the chance,
consider the check - ALWAYS. From the defense's
perspective it helps to not give away free moves.}
 8. a3 d6xe5
{White takes leave of his senses. A lesson in White's
mistaken 8th move is to evaluate the threat before you
move. The suspicion is that White is playing 8. a3
for one of two reasons. Either White does not have an
idea [plan] or White fears the move ....Bb4. The
problem with White's move it is that it opens the door
for Black to capture on e4. Either ...dxe4 or Nxe4 is
strong.}
9. f4xe5 f6xe4 10. Qh5 Nd7
{Now Black runs out of ideas. I know that it looks
like Black should develop but there are more pressing
issues at hand - like survival. The move, 10. Qh5
introduces a very dangerous idea that must keep Black
on guard. It is necessary for black to play ...f5. The
result of this is that the Bishop on d3 is permanently
taken out of the game. If White tries 11. exf6 [en
passant] then 11...Nxf6 covers the vital h7 square and
tackles the Queen on h5. The White attack fizzles.
This game can be a lesson in handling dangerous ideas
casually. On defense you must be aggressive!}
11. b4 g6
{White "baits" Black into taking at c3. In the
process, White drops the piece. The Black move of g6
is correct.}
12. Qh6 e4xc3
{Black picks up the piece. This is correct. However
there is a short lesson to be learned in this move.
Whenever you capture material, you in essence give
something up. In short, you give up two moves [one to
capture the piece and one to put the capturing piece
back on the square you want it]. You must weigh the
cost of the time against the material won. In most
cases take the piece but think it through first. If
you are in doubt that you will survive the coming
attack - don't grab the material. At this point the
material grab is safe and gives Black a huge
advantage.}
13. Bg5 Qc7
{Black loses immediately. Now Black must play 13...
f6. The best White can hope for now is the perpetual
check [or draw by three-fold repetition]. However the
game is far from over. White's initiative is still
very dangerous. For example, 13. Bg5 f6 14. Bxf6 Nxf6
15. exf6 Rxf6. Then there is 15. Bxg6 hxg6 16. Qxg6
Kh8 and White gains the draw by repetition [perpetual
check]. On 15 Bxg6 Nce4 16.exf6 Nxf6 17. O-O Qe7 18.
Rxf6 Rxf6 Black wins easily. On 14. exf6 Nxf6 Black
should still be safe - but under pressure.}

{You asked a question at the beginning: "I have been
playing for about 12 years. I have only got serious about my
chess in the last 2 years. I have a strong love for chess and I
played at least 2 games everyday for the last 2 years. I
don't have a rating, but I feel I am pretty good. I have no
one to play but the computer. So, I am self-taught in
everything I know. please tell me if I'm on the right track."
 Answer: First, I am glad you love chess. The
fact is that chess is plain fun. I really does not
matter what your skill level is if you can enjoy what
you are doing. I did not win a game the first two
years that I played, but I had fun anyway. There are
several ways to gain a chess rating. You can go to
United States Chess Federation rated tournaments.
These are official ratings. You can play chess
on-line and gain a rating that is not official but can
give you an idea of your strength [I know these
ratings are debatable but...]. You can play a chess
program that will rate your level of play. Remember
that the "rating" is only a measure of relative
strength.
 As far as being "self taught" is concerned, we
all need help at times. There are many good books
that can help teach us. Silman's "Amateurs Mind" and
"How to Reassess your chess" are the best at this
point in complete instructional manuals for most
players (under the Master level). There are many
places on-line that offer instruction. If you love
chess, then you will find the study of chess enjoyable
when there is no opponent around. It is also fun to
hit your unsuspecting neighbor with something you just
learned in your studies. There is a problem with
studying chess, the better you get the less
competitive the neighborhood games become. In other
words, it becomes less fun if you do not have a
serious challenge. One method of correction for this
is what my first chess teacher once said, every chess
player has the moral obligation to help teach others
the game. Teaching kids in the schools is a great
chance to stretch yourself.
 About being on the "right track," that depends on
what you want to accomplish. If you want to beat your
neighborhood you are fine. Cut back on the mistakes
and learn to play with your pawns and you will give
most of your local friends fits. I think the critical
element in your immediate improvement is to understand
pawn play.
 In the game as Black, you gave yourself a "Bad
Bishop." That is a Bishop where the central pawns are
on the same color as the Bishop. In essence this is
playing a piece down. Part of the reason for the
Opening you chose [the Karo-Cann] is to avoid the bad
bishop. For the most part you need to play the Bishop
to f5 before you play ...e6. The Bishop is technically
"bad" but it is active [useful]. Remember that pawn
will dictate your strategy both offensively and
defensively. Use them to create space, permanent out
posts and create weakness in your opponent's camp.
Remember chess is war, these pawns are the foot
soldiers. You can not win a war without putting
troops on the ground and winning as much space as
possible.
 To get an accurate "track" a coach would have to
examine at least 50 games over several years time
period. What you are looking for is an improvement.
By that, look to understand what mistakes you commonly
make. Then eliminate them. This will make you much
stronger by virtue of the fact that you are not
helping your opponent! Also there are set of basic
applications that a chess coach will look for that
includes pawn play, piece interaction, and pattern
recognition [et. al.]. The goal is to improve over
time. The painful thing is that this process takes a
fearless moral inventory, something that few have the
courage to do. Still, keep at it. Enjoy the game.
Teach someone else.}

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 g6 4. Nf3
{As you probably know, this position denotes the Grand Prix
attack. With proper play, black would equalize -- though
not without its pitfalls for black.}
4... Bg7 5. Bb5 e6
{?! This gives white a nice game. 5. ... Nd4! gives black
equality. Why, you ask? Several reasons 1) doesn't let
white double black's pawns on c6 2) let's white's bishop
stay a target. For example, 6. Nxd4 cxd4 7. Ne2 Nf6 8. d3?? Qa5+ 3)
the knight at d4 can't be booted from d4 by c3, since white's
knight occupies that square.}
6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. O-O Ne7 8. d3 Bxc3
{? This severely weakens black's dark squares and his king-side.
More logical is continued development with 8. ... 0-0
9. Be3 b6 10. Qe1 Ba6, with the idea of ..c4 to undouble
black's pawns.}
9. bxc3 Qb6 10. c4
{! A strong multi-purpose move. Here's what it does:
1) fixes the black c5 pawn, keeping a target 2) controls d5,
so that black can't use that central square for his pieces when
white plays an eventual e5 to create an potential outpost for
white's knight at d6. 3) It evens opens up the a1-h8 diagonal
for white's bishop.}
10... Bd7 11. Be3 Qa5 12. Bd2 Qc7 13. Bc3 Rg8
{Good. You didn't fall for 13. ... O-O? 14. Bf6! Rae8 15. Qe1
with a winning king-side attack.}
14. Be5
{Dubious. This should've forced black to go to his most active
square (...Qa5). White has a MUCH stronger move instaed -- 14. Bf6!
This would put a massive cramp on black. Black can't mobilize
his king-side or center, he can't castle, and he can't even take
white's f4 pawn. (14. ... Qxf4 15 Ne5 with a clear advantage
for white. Try to work it out). White's bishop is a far
superior piece to black's knight at e7.}
14... Qc8 15. Bd6 b6 16. Bxe7
{This isn't bad, but again -- white's bishop is far superior
to black's knight. Why shouldn't white intensify pressure on
the dark squares with Qe1, with the idea of Qh4.}
16... Kxe7 17. e5 b5 18. Qe1 Rh8 19. Qf2
{?! This cashes in too early. White's winning chances in the
middle game are excellent. 19. Ng5 with the idea of Ne4, and
possibly Qh4, leaves white with a great game. Notice that white
is pratically a piece up, because of the limited scope of black's
bishop on d7, compared to white's knight.}
19... Qf8
{! A resourceful move! Black's chances aren't great, but
certainly they are better in the endgame than the middle
game. This is because black's king stuck in the center
is a drawback in the the middle game, but an advantage in
an ending.}
20. Qxc5+ Ke8 21. Qxf8+ Kxf8 22. c5 a5 23. a4
{I don't like this move (though it is okay). I'm sure white's
idea was to create a target on a5 and to create a potential
reroute for his knight (Nd2-c4), but his was unnecessary since
white could always reroute by Nd2-e4. I like 23. a3, keeping
white's pawn opposite black's bishop (hence not a target).
Here's a general rule to remember -- the farther advanced a
pawn is, the more vulnerable it is.}
23... b4 24. Nd2 Kg7 25. Nc4 Rhb8 26. Rfb1 h5 27. Rb2 Ra7
28. Rab1 Rbb7 29. Kf2 f6
{Notice that if white would have posted his knight in the center
(e4), this break would not even be possible.}
30. Ke2 Be8 31. exf6+
{Simply 31. c3 would've won a pawn for white. Note that earlier,
c3 wasn't possible because after the exchange of rooks on b7,
black could've played ...c2! and white could not have stopped
the pawn. It doesn't work now, however, because the white
king is within range of the c-pawn.}
31... Kxf6 32. h4 Rd7 33. Nd6 Ra8 34. d4 Rad8 35. Kd3 Rxd6
{Good! I would've done this myself. Passive play is sure
to lose -- active play is black's best chance.}
36. cxd6 Rxd6 37. c3 c5 38. Kc4 bxc3 39. Kxc3
{39. dxc5! retains white's advantage.}

48. Rg5+ Kf3 49. Ke5 b3 50. Kf6 Be8 51. Rc5 b2 52. Rc3+ Kg4
53. Rb3 Ba4
{? This gives white winning chances. Even in an endgame,
activity of yoru pieces is paramount. 53. ... Bc6! draws
by force AND has a subtle trap. If 54. Kxg6?? b1Q+ 55. Rxb1 Be4+
would force white to resign! And if white tries Rxb2 instead of
Kxg6, then Be4 sets up a fortress. This is a common motif for
the side with less material. White's rook for bishop in that
position would be worthless.}
54. Rxb2 Kxg3 55. Kxg6
{? White throws his win away. 55. Kg5! preserves the win.
The idea is to drive black's king away with a check on the
third rank, then pick off either the e6 or g6 pawn, and finally
to sacrifice the rook at the right moment to get a winning K + P
endgame.}

{00034.5.19 Analyzed by Candidate Master Daniel Waite}
{For having only a year of experience you played well.
I'm sure by now you have realized that your demise is
due to the loss of the d-file. However, the difficult
part is to figure out how this happened. Let's take a
look.}
1.e4 c6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3
{This is the "Two Knights Variation." It is an
attempt to confuse the Caro-Kann player. Keene
considers this "sharp" while Schiller calls it
"quiet." How you handle it is a matter of
personality. If you choose to give up the Bishop pair
early you must keep the game "closed." (All four
center pawns on the board.) Thus, when the d-file
opens you invite trouble.}
3...Bg4 4.h3 Bxf3 5.Qxf3 e6
{Solid, but.... As a defender you must be aggressive.
You also have the option to transpose into more
familiar territory with 3....dxe4 4. Nxe4 5. Bf5. Also
a tempting idea between moves 3 through 9 is the move
...d4. This is an attempt to close the center and gain
space on the Queenside. Again this is a matter of
personality. My favorite way of attacking the Two
Knights Variation is to play 5...Nf6 if 6. e5 then the
center will be permanently locked giving you the
chance to make your Knights better than the opponent's
Bishops. You can choose between Nfd7 and Ne4. If
White tries 6.d5 then 6...dxe4. The idea is that Black
gains a move (tempo) 7.Qe3 e6 (The d4 pawn is
undefended if 7.Nxe4 Qxd4.). Now after the exchange
on e4 the Queen Knight heads for d5 through d7 and f6.
The idea is to plant the Knight securely on d5,
making it, in theory better than the White Bishop
pair.}
6.d3 Nf6
{Here is the chance to create some interesting
possibilities. For instance 6....d4 7. Ne2 Qb6. White
is forced to commit to some sort of stand on the
Queenside. One idea would be to play 8. c3. The
problem with this idea is that Black is not developed
properly. The "total war" that will develop is going
to be difficult.}
7.Bd2 c5
{While not objectively unsound, 7....c5 invites many
problems. Here the problem again is the lack of
development. Typically in these pawn positions Black
is going to want to play ...Bd6 and ...Nd7 before ...c5.
Even stronger is if Black can also achieve a Rook on
the c - file. Now consider the possibilities of 7....
Nbd7 8. O-O-O Bd6. Now Black can try to "clear and
seal" with ...c5 and ...d4. The concept involves clearing
the Knight from it's defensive post and using the pawn
structure to seal off the opponents pieces on the
opposite side of the board. This takes courage
because you will need to castle on the opposite side
and attack without counting the cost (sacrifice almost
everything if necessary). However, you do get to
isolate the King away from any reinforcements.}
8.g4 Nc6 9.0-0-0 Be7
{The question for you to answer will be the pawn
charge on the g - file. You might want to experiment
with the Sicilian Dragon. After facing the Yugoslav
Attack, you will loose the fear of these pawn charges.
Even here you can play 9...d4. A good rule is to
always play in the center (e and d files). When you
face an attack on the wing (side) become active in the
center. Generally the stronger of the attacks will
occur in the center.}
10.g5 dxe4 11.dxe4 Nd7 12.h4 Nd4 13.Qg3 Qb6 14.Ne2 Bd6
15.f4 0-0-0 16.Bc3 Nxe2
{16. Bc3? After building a strong initiative, with a
little help from your passive game, White plays a poor
move. 16. Nxd4 cxd4 17. e5 Bc7 looks more interesting
for White. With the d - file open and the Knight
planted on d4 Black can easily equalize with 16...e5.
If 17. Bxd4 cxd5 gains a strong initiative for Black.
Even 17. Nxd4 exd4 neuters the Bishop and gets you
back into the game. With this exchange Black
accomplishes several of White's major goals. (As much
as possible, do not help your opponent. Never force
your opponent to do something that you will regret!)
First, Black opens the d - file White's only means of
attack. Second Black opens the long diagonal (a1- h8)
for White, in effect giving White the center.
Finally, Black opens (abandons) the center. Once you
post a Knight in your opponent's territory keep it
there or make the opponent sacrifice (or pay a high
price) to get rid of it. The reward for this is that
White will seize the d - file and disrupt Black's "key
ranks" (the 1,2,7,8 ranks) with the Bishops.}
17.Be2 Qc7 18.Rhf1 Rhg8 19.Bd3 g6 20.Qf2 Rde8 21.Kb1
Nb8 22.Bb5 Nc6 23.Bf6 a6 24.e5 Be7
{Giving up the Bishop is a new concession that in
effect looses the game. The Bishop was the only piece
that was keeping the Black Rooks from invading your
territory. One general idea is for the defender to
trade off attacking pieces. However, that guideline
is wrong in this situation. Principle: You must do
what the position demands. Do not just follow general
ideas or try to force your will on the position. You
can still fight on after 24... Bf8.}
25.Bxe7 Rxe7 26.Bxc6 Qxc6 27.Rd6 Qc7 28.Rfd1 Kb8
29.R1d3 c4 30.R3d4 c3 31.b3 Rc8
{A fascinating idea at this point is 31....Qa5. Black's
move 31....Rc8 does not help.}
32.Rc4 Qa5 33.Rxc8+ Kxc8 34.Qa7 Qc7
{Now for a review. Black allowed White to capture the
d - file. This was complicated by giving up the
strong Knight at d4 and sealed by giving up the Bishop
guarding d6. Your weak points seem to be the lack of
control of the central squares, lack of understanding
pawn play, and (I suspect) the inability to understand
the board position. Now for the good: somehow you
managed to maintain your balance in a difficult
position. You came up with a creative attacking idea
(29....c4) when you needed it. With a solid
understanding of the position and your creativity you
will be a tough opponent for anyone. Suggestions:
Focus your game on the center. I'd suggest that you
attack the center with simplifying ideas such as
closed pawn structures or open (no pawns in the
center) games. You may want to consider charting the
pawn structures in your games. For instance, you may
do better in positions without center pawns. I would
suggest that you explore more aggressive openings -
especially gambits. While you are charting your games
give careful attention to when you make your errors.
For instance in this game you could mark moves 16 and
24 as major errors. When you come up to your common
problem moves, give yourself extra time to think
through your move and remind yourself of your
weaknesses. Keep up the good work. Honestly
analyzing your games will bring fast improvement.}

{Every chess player must progress through stages. At
the age of 15 and a rating of 1179 this is not a good
opening for you. Until you reach the 1500+ level you

Re8 30. b3
{The win was a matter of time. Some lessons from this
game would include the following ideas. First when
you started with 1. Nf3 you told your opponent that
you were not a tactical threat and probably have
trouble on defense. This invited his unsound attacks,
which must have kept you busy. You must understand
that your opponent must still be beaten. Generally
time problems are a matter of attitude. The suspicion
is that you fell into the trap of what Soltis calls,
"Believing Him." This is a fear of attack, respecting
your opponent, second guessing, not trusting your
calculation, reacting to your opponent instead of
playing your own plans, seeing threats where none
exist. Another very common problem is the "over
calculation syndrome." This when a player will
consider line "A" then go on to line "B" and so forth.
 Possibly the player will then consider "C" which will
be rejected. Now the player will go back and think
through line "A" and then see line "D." After all
this time, the player will consider line "B" again
then panic. The player will realize that a lot of
time has been lost in uncertain ideas and play move
"E" which as not yet been analyzed.
Several cures natural present themselves. First, play
a "forcing system." (Colle, Stonewall, King's Indian
Attack, etc.) If you are addicted to 1. Nf3 as a
starting move you can try the King's Indian Attack.
There are several nice ideas surrounding 1.e4 that are
positionally strong and provide lots of chances for
quick wins. Mainly the Max Lange and King's Gambit.
Try to strengthen your tactical abilities. This will
help you calculate the severity of your opponent's
attack. If you know what you will play the first 8
moves of a game, it will save time. Second, develop
an attitude. Put to use "Fischer's Rule." Attack
something, if it doesn't move take it! If you cherish
positional chess, learn end games. (This fits well
with "Fischer's Rule.") The idea is to get to end
games against higher rated players as quickly as
possible. This puts them on your territory and at a
huge disadvantage since few players have learned end
game play. Another way of putting this might be: play
to your strengths. Never look at your opponent's
rating. If you did not know this player was a 1700
player you would have thought he was a beginner and
treated him like a complete idiot. Finally, after a
loss ask yourself: "Where did I give the opponent
control of the game?"}

Black's control of the middle, weak King position.
(All tactics are based on positional elements.)

understand how this line has led you to a miserable

computer would make.}
13... Bd4
{Chess lesson #1: Black takes advantage of a "pivot
point." This is the square(s) that the Bishop uses to
attack the same side of the board that it sits on.
Often we see a Bishop cutting across a diagonal but
the real danger comes from these pivot points where
suddenly it is attacking back across the grain. This
move is brought to you courtesy of your lack of
development.}

You should have tried Bg5, Bf4, Nc3, or Nd2. When

can not afford the time to chase pieces. Besides, c3
does nothing to move the Bishop of the "dangerous
diagonal" (the diagonal that bears down on your f2/f7
square). You are completely lost at this point.
Chess lesson #2: Development is more important than
breathing! Chess in a sense is a war game where you
must mobilize your troops. If you do not, you insure
an easy game for your opponent. Again, this is
another computer like mistake. Play more live
opponents.}
15...Ne4
{Chess lesson #3: Pattern recognition. First, your
King is on the back row with no breathing room.
Second, you have to deal with the open files. The one
that is going to seal your fate is the d - file.

{Chess lesson #5: Imbalances. An imbalance is any
difference in the position. At this point you are 2
Bishops & Rook verses Queen and Pawn. Not bad as far
as material is concerned. However, look at how the
Knight dominates both your Bishops and Rook. This is
called the "superior minor piece." In spite of your
material differences, you are playing a virtual Rook,
Knight, and Bishop down (pieces that have not been
developed). Black also has his pick of the d - file,
the f - file, and the a7 - g1 diagonal.}

Qf4 29.Be3
{This move is not possible - the Bishop can not move
though the Queen on f4. Thus I'm assuming the correct
move was 28...Qh4. Chess lesson #6: Pins. Somewhere I
read/heard that 80% of Master level games are decided
by a pin. In this case the pin is "absolute." In
other words you can not move the pinned piece. (A
"relative" pin is when you can move the pinned piece -
at the cost of what's behind it.) You must deal with
a pin immediately if not sooner! There are three ways
to do this: move the piece that is behind the pin,
attack the pinning piece, and impose another piece
in-between. For instance, look at the common
"relative" pin of a Black Bishop on g4, White Knight
on f3 and Queen on d1. You can move the Queen,
"question the Bishop" with h3 (which generally leads
to an exchange), or play Be2 (freeing the Knight and
the Queen).}

{Chess lesson #7: Never resign! You can not win if
you resign. You have a combination of interesting
ideas available to you. First, your opponent is
crushing you like a bug - you have him just where you
want him. Second, you have two Bishops on a very open
board and a Rook sitting on an open file. The
conditions are ripe for a major league swindle.
Possible over-confidence or carelessness can sometimes
be used to steal a point. Try 35. Rd7+, if Black
carelessly moves 35...Kc8 you force mate. If 35. Rd7+
Kb8 36. Bd6 again tempting ...Kc8 forcing mate (37. Bc7+
Kd8 38. Rc8#). Develop a reputation for being
dangerous when you are cornered. If chess is a war,
it is not an honorable one. You must try every
filthy, disgusting, ugly, swindle opportunity the
board position gives you. Just be a gentleman and
don't gloat, laugh or put down your opponent. There
is a difference gritty chess and bad sportsmanship.}

on developing their pieces, controlling the center, and
getting their kings into safety (with the exception of black's
prophylactic...h6).}
6. Nc3
{The last move is certainly playable and logical, but should
lead to an equal game. 6. c3 would keep more of the pieces
on the board and retain greater flexibility, and hence
generate more winning chances for white than the text.
Grandmasters and masters alike, if they assay the Guicco Piano
(3. Bc4) will almost invariably choose 6. c3.}
6... Nf6 7. Be3 Nd4
{A good move by black. This prevents 8. d4 by white, which
is both line-opening and space grabbing. In addition, black
can now boot any white piece that tries to plant itself at
d5 by playing his pawn to c6, and last but not least, white
will have to remove his dark squared bishop to get rid of
the black knight on d4, since 8. Nxd4?? exd4 would lose a piece.}
8. Na4 Bg4
{Good. This completes development while pinning white's
knight on f3 to the white queen. 8. ... Bg4 also shows
that black is paying attention, as white was threatening
to win a pawn with 9. Nxc5 dxc5 10. Nxe5.}
9. Bxd4 Bxd4 10. c3 Bb6 11. Nxb6
{?! Since black's bishop wasn't going anywhere, there was
no need to rush this capture. Instead, white has a chance
to break the pin by playing 11 Qb3!?. If black takes white's
knight with ...Bxf3, then white replies Bxf7+ (check!) K moves
and gxf3. It's true white's pawns are doubled, but they
reinforce white's center, plus of course white has the pawn
plus. And at any convenient time, white can eliminate that
bishop on b6.}

alternatives, since the queen would be preserved. A queen
trade goes into an endgame where black has doubled-pawns,
which may favor white slightly.}
16. dxe5 Bxf3 17. Qxf3 dxe5 18. Rd1 Qe7

on e5 and f7, gets the queen out of danger, and leaves open
the option to post the queen to c5, if convenient.}
19. Qf5
{considering the black knight guards d7, this move does nothing.
White may have been worried by ...Nd7-c5, but a3 would be a
better response. a3 would allow the white Bishiop to move
(now that it isn't tied down), which could allow Bc2 in some
lines to defend the e-pawn. Also, the general rule is: keep
pawns the opposite color of your bishop, if possible.}
19... Rfd8 20. Red3 c5
{! A nice move which takes advantage of white's dubious Qf5.
Clearly, white cannot try to win a pawn with 21. Rxd8 Rxd8

the bishop and mate, and there is no way to defend against
both, and white has no perpetual checks.}
21. c4
{If white has to play this (which he does), then clearly
something went wrong. after black plays ...b4, then white's
c-pawn is a potential target, d4 is opened up as a potential
outpost for the black pieces, and the pawn blocks white's
own light squared bishop. Notice that if white had played
a3 earlier, then in response to ...c5 he could have simply
played Bc2, with an even game.}
21... b4 22. Rxd8+ Rxd8 23. Rxd8+ Qxd8 24. Qxe5 Qd2

31... Nxb5 32. Bd3 Nc3 33. Kf3 Kf7

the queenside, and 43. ... g5 44. fxg5 fxg5 45. hxg5 hxg5

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.
Nc3 Bb4
{The French Winawer. In theory it is solid yet
aggressive. You choose an older inflexible way to
meet it (and more difficult to defend against).
Typically White will unleash a strong Kingside attack
with Qg4.}
 4. e5 c5 5. a3 cxd4!?
{This move makes sense. Objectively it may be
questionable but it offers Black two pluses. First it
gives Black the half-open c - file. Second it breaks
up the White center pawns. One reason for questioning
this move is that it does not appear to be consistent
with the objectives of Black's choice of opening.
Always remember there is a plus in every negative on
the chessboard. Chess is an exchange of advantages
and disadvantages. For instance, if you drop a piece
you generally get two moves in exchange for it.
Sometimes the two moves are more critical than the
piece. It is the reason that sacrifices work. That
is why chess coaches warn younger players to not chase
pawns. It is not worth the moves that are given up.
In the games that I've seen, it appears that Black
wants a quick resolution to the game by choosing this
move.}
 6. Qxd4 Bxc3
{Interesting try for Black, typically the play would
be either ...Nc6 or ...Ba5. Again the move makes sense,
but remember in chess that there is an absolute truth
at work. Wrong moves should be punished by accurate
play.}
 7. Qxc3 Nc6 8. Bb5
{At this point the idea would be to play Qg3. The
forcing of the ...g6 gives White a huge positional
advantage with the pawn at e5 and the absence of the
Black's dark square Bishop. If Black castles Kingside
he should not be able to defend himself.}
8...Bd7 9. Nf3 d4?
{This move is too ambitious at this point. Now Black
will be stuck with an over-extended pawn. In the French,
Black must defend first, THEN attack. Development was
essential on move 9.
Again a move that makes sense. 9...d4 is not as bad as
you think. The move is not an "attack." Pawn moves
are seldom for purposes of "attack." As a general
rule, the idea of the pawn move is to gain or control
space. I do however agree that this move is ill timed
and too ambitious. In a sense the pawn is sacrificed
for open lines. The problem for Black is that these
open lines benefit White! BTW, in every defense the
idea is to "defend first, THEN attack." All attacks
must have positional justification. Black does have a
problem unraveling his development in the French
Defense - your opponent compounds this natural
problem. This is why I do not personal recommend the
French Defense you young players. If you are
interested in completely frustrating someone playing
the French Defense try the "Exchange Variation." It
takes all the fun out of it for Black.}
10. Qd3 Ne7 11. Bg5
{Black's development is now becoming less effective
because his pieces are being pinned and becoming useless.
Black is cramped but at this point is fine. Do not
mistake a cramped position for a bad position. Some
defenses are specifically designed to make maxim use
of as little space as possible. These can be very
tough to crack and if the attacker relaxes or
mishandles the position, it could get real ugly real
fast. One characteristic of a cramped position is the
interlocking of pieces. This is called "over
protection." The idea is that for every attacker on a
piece there is at least one more defender. This makes
the various pieces more flexible - you can move any
defender and not give up material. About pins: You
place a high value on them for good reason. Pins
often decide the game! There are two types of pins.
There is the "absolute" pin. These are pins where the
first piece can not move because the King is behind
it. Then there is the "relative" pin where the
defender can choose to give up material. The
difference is that the second is flexible while the
first is not. The "magic" behind the pin is the
inflexibility of the pinned piece and generally its'
defender. With one piece you can tie up as many as
three defenders! That's like playing a virtual piece
or two ahead. Another thing to like about pins is
that they can quickly become a permanent positional
advantage. Once you get a pin, work on the front
piece - start piling up the attack on it.}
11. ...a6
{Missing ...Qa5+ and ...Nxe5. The stronger of the two
would be ...Nxe5, completely dissolving the White center
and freeing Black's game. The draw back is that it
scrambles the Black pawns and leaves White with a 2 -
3 pawn island advantage. The question is if a free
game and an advantage in the center would be worth
it?}
12. Bxc6 Bxc6 13. 0-0-0 0-0
{Black should have tried 13...Qd5. This makes use of
the earlier ...d4 move. 14. Qxd4 Qxd4 15.Nxd4 Bxg2 16.
Rhg1 Be4 and Black has placed his Bishop on a
dominating square can go just about anywhere
unhindered. This pivot point is critical. On 15.
Rxd4 then Bxf3 is strong for Black.}
14. Nh4 h6 15. Bf6!
{A bolt from the blue for Black! My intuition kept
nagging at me to play 15. Bf6, so I had to use
almost half of
my time to give the gut feeling a green light.
You knew better, generally your first instincts are
correct. The old rule of thumb is "long analysis is
wrong analysis" at the board. This drops a piece.
Let's examine why the move is not good. First, it
gives away the Bishop for a pawn without time
advantage. Second, it does not force anything. When
you sacrifice it must be forcing. Black is not
obliged to capture.}
15. ...gxf6 16. Qg3+ Ng6
{Here Black, in essence, blunders the game away.
16...Kh7 17. exf6 Ng6 and Black is home free with extra
material.}
17. Nxg6 fxg6?
{This was Black's last chance to defend himself by not
taking back the Knight and moving his King over to the
h-file, giving up the Exchange.
You got that right!}
18. Qxg6+ Kh8 19. Qxh6+
{If I couldn't find an absolute win, I knew I could at
least give perpetual check.
Attitude check. When you have your opponent in your
sights never, never, never consider the draw. In
fact, never consider a draw until you are absolutely
sure the position is completely lifeless - or you are
tricking your opponent out of half a point. Even in
completely lost positions there is value in playing
them out - you learn a lot by the hard spots in life.
Don't pass up your best learning opportunities.}
19. ...Kg8 20. Qg6+ Kh8 21. Re3 Bxg2
{The only move that can prevent an immediate mate by
22. Rh3+}
22. Rg1! Rg8??
{Congratulations! You finished with a good score. In
this game you took advantage of your opponents
weakness/mistakes. You were also aggressive and
willing to take a risk. You must study the
"positional" aspects of the game. To attack you must
have positional justification. To sacrifice material
you should have concrete analysis all the way through
to checkmate. Also when you sacrifice focus on
forcing moves. You showed excellent insight into some
ideas in the game and you made sure your position was
solid. Once you get a grip on the positional essence
and learning how to read the board, you'll be a match
for just about anyone under the Master level.}

1. d4 f5?!
{The Dutch defense is becoming less and less used in
masterplay due to evolving opening theory and refuting
ideas. Much stronger is the classic
King's Indian with 1...Nf6 or Queen's Pawn game with 1...d5.}

2. c4 Bb4+?
{Unnecessarily restrictive. The simple 2...Nf6 was called
for or setting up the stonewall formationwith 2...d5 with 3...c6
to follow. TheStonewall is well-known as an "Anti-computer"
defense because the positionstend to be reliant on long term
positional maneuvering and not quick tacticalflares..
This allows white a free handin the center to push to
e4 and increase his spatial advantage and to openlines to
use his superior development. The text is easily refuted
with 3. Nc3 where any exchange on c3 can only benefit white.}
3. Bd2 (A playable alternative) Bxd2?!
{Not the best continuation here either. Much more logical
is 3...Qe7, when 4. g3 Nf65. Bg2 0-0 6. 0-0 and only now Bxd2
where black doesn't stand nearly as badly. The text relinquishes
Black'scontrol of the center as well as speed
in development.}
4. Nxd2 Nc6?!
{Another dubious move. Better is 4...Nf6 5. e3 b6 6. Bd3 c5
7. 0-0 and then 7...Nc6 when Blackdoesn't stand as badly.
Black isn'tgiving White much to
think about.}
5. e4!?
{A good decision. Tobe considered as stronger, however, is 5. g3 with a
kingside fianchettogradually building up the position. Attempts to retain the
initiative with 5. d5 Nce7 6. dxe6 dxe6 onlysucceed in helping black
mobilize. Opening the position early like this without the development to
back it up can lead to disaster.}
5...fxe4 6. Nxe4 d5?
{The first blunder. The e-file was already white's avenue of attack as long as
the blackking is in the center. Weakening thee-file for white even further
does not help matters. Not only is the e-pawn weak, but the king is weak!
Much better was the obvious 7...Nf6 with acastle kingside.}
7. Nc5?!
{A questionable move. Certainly the knight cannot establish himself here. It
would seem as though this warrior wouldlike to fight on black's weak side of
the board, the kingside. 7. Ng3 would be begging to be played. Now, Black
can solidify with 7...Nge7!}
7...b6?!
{7...Nge7 kept things together in excellent order for blackwith the idea of 0-0
and Nf5 followed by Qd6 solidifying with chances. Also, eventual e5 advances
would begin to become feasible. There's no reason to immediately chase
the knight away from its post.}
8. Nb3 Bb7?
{A blunder. Black may feel obligated to play that move because of b6, however
it is imperative thathe castle as soon as possible. Therefore, 8...Nge7! with
the idea of 0-0 Nf5 and Nce7 would be indicatedfor Black. Another possible
move, evenmore aggressive perhaps, is 8...Qf6!? threatening Nge7 with even
stronger forceas the ideas dxc4 followed by Nd5 are now possible. After the
text white can pick which side of the board to play on(queenside, center,
kingside) as he has prospects in each area.}
9. Qd2?
{White could choose to play in the center which would revolvearound attacking
the e-pawn and controlling the e-file most like starting withideas like 9.
Qe2. White could chooseto play on the queenside (now that black played b6)
because of the ideainvolved with 9. c5! (making the b7 bishop look pretty
ridiculous) and Rc1, a strongidea, with invasion on the c-file. Lastly, the
kingside where black's king remains open. Moves such as 9. Bd3 come to
mind.
D2 is a poor square for the queen as she is not involved inany real plan and
she's exposed to attack on this square (Ng8-f6-e4) etc. Passivity resembles
this move. Black still does have to deal with thesomewhat distant threat of
Bd3 followed by Ng5 with a fork on the h and epawns. However, intending Ng5
so theknight can be protected from the queen at d2 is a poor reason to play
themove. With correct play, Black could'vepounced on this.}
9...dxc4?
{Allows white to develop with tempo with subsequent pressureon the new
isolated e-pawn. It's toobig of a trade-off between all these cons and the
one and only pro of morebishop activity. 9...Nf6! was the indicatedmove.}
10. Bxc4
{Here, it doesn't take a Garry Kasparov or Vishy Anand to seethat white is
well ahead in position. Space advantage, more piece mobility, a lead in
development, attackingchances, the list could go on and on. The main trump
black holds is the long diagonal and the d-file. But use of these means
doesn't leave as goodof impression as White's.}
10...Bc8?
{In an inferior position, Black picks the worst way possibleto defend the
pawn. 10...Qf6 would'vebeen indicated.}
11. Ng5!
{I personally would've castled kingside first to increasepressure with Re1 as
well, but one can hardly call the text an error.}
11...Na5??
{A game-losing blunder. If Black intended to sacrifice the isolated e-pawn, he
should've done sowith 11...Nf6. Now the position becomeswide open and tactics
loom left and right. Only the better developed, fully-mobilized side can
profit from this.}
12. Nxa5! bxa5 13. Nxe6 Bxe6 14. Bxe6 Qe7 15. d5?!
{Much superior to the text is of course, 15. 0-0.}
15...Nf6!?
{Not bad at all. Thelong awaited Nf6! However, here thecapture on e6
would've been a stronger preparatory combination to the text.}
16. 0-0
{Of course, this can't be an error, however consider thestronger 16. 0-0-0!
with the strong threat of d6!.}
16...a4??

Black needed to liquidate with 16...Bxe6 nodoubt about it. Now 17. Rae1! wins
the game.}

possible here. Black heads into the "Little Center."
Several idea to attack this center would be to get in
f5, Bxe6, Nxe6, Nd5. The move e5 can also be
disruptive to the Black center. Another common idea
for attacking this set up is to play c4. There are
two essential elements here. First, prevent Black
from freeing himself with ...d5. Second, play the KB to
the a2 - g8 diagonal (Bobby Fischer). This
opportunistic diagonal has paid rich rewards to many
players. Key squares for White are d5 and e6. White
tends to attack on the Kingside, while Black aims at
the Queenside. Control these and win. Black
meanwhile wants to pressure the pawn at e4 (and
support ...d5). Black's main strategy tends to be to
head to the endgame as soon as possible (the pawn
structure favors Black in the endgame). All this

{Your strength, in this game, is a strong positional
feel that is rare in young players. You seem to have
two weaknesses. First, you do not demonstrate a
willingness to attack, even though you had positional
justification. This tends to come from lack of
experience and lack of knowing basic attacking motifs.
 Second, you don't seem to understand the idea of the
opening. (Very few do, in OTB. Play postal and you
will learn the ideas very quickly or lose badly,
quickly.) I would suggest that you switch to the
Queen's Gambit to capitalize on your positional
awareness. Work on the common tactical ideas, learn
patterns. Maybe one thing that will help you in the
area of attack is to pick up a gambit as a "change up"
style (what you pull out for fun or when you've been
scouted at a tourney). This will add spice (not to
mention confusion) to your opponent's life. If you
want to work on your positional understanding, study
the games of Karpov - who just happens to be creative
attacker. (I can hear the laughter of those who have
never studied his games.) Also read Silman's "How to
Reassess" book, if you haven't done so already. When
all else fails, I'm looking for new students! (LOL)}

{00042.6.05 Analyzed by Candidate Master Charles Oberweiser
This is my friend, Tim Smith's, exhibition game before
the actual tournament. This was not at tournament time
controls (40 moves/120 minutes, 20 moves/60 minutes,
and 30 minutes), but it was at 90 minutes for each side
for all moves. I was at this tournament with him and
helped him prepare his openings for the psychological
aspect of his opponent.}
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4
{We thought this would be our best weapon against Tom
because he tends toward the Hungarian opening, an opening
that begins a stream of tactical ideas that usually favor
white. We wanted to accentuate the fact that Tim is a
Kasparov-like calculator.}
3. Be7
{Sure enough. He played the Hungarian. Everything's
according to plan.}
4. d4 exd4?!
{We didn't expect this. This is an inferior move because it
allows the white e-pawn to drive back the black pieces.
4. d6 is indicated completing development.}
5. c3!?
{Tim usually plays the sharp 5. 0-0 here, but he surprised
his opponent. This gives the game numerous complications.}
5. Nf6?
{Tim quoted in post-game analysis, "I'm surprise he played
this move. In order to not lose tempi he must weaken his
kingside. Right from this moment I knew my game plan."
Better was 5. Na5 taking advantage of the exposed
position of the white bishop where white would respond
with 6. Qxd4.}
6. e5!
{Punishing black's inaccuracy the first time he gets a
chance. This pawn needed to be restrained with d6 before
the king's knight would come out a la Nimzovich.}
6. Ne4 7. Bd5!
{This move prevents d5 to protect the newly-attacked
e4-knight so Black has to weaken his kingside in order
to not lose tempi.}
7. f5?! 8. cxd4
{A simple glance at the position will show that white
has built up a strong mobile center. Black needs to
attack it at once or he will risk being crushed.
White's main problem is the e4-knight.}
8. Bb4+?!
{Moving the same piece twice allowing White to build up
time (development) and initiative. While this isn't a
huge blunder in itself, it can be pounced on in the long
run with accurate play. Better was 8. Nb4 (I know,
moving the same piece twice again, but this time it's
dislodging the central bishop in order to get the strong
9. d5! with counterplay). Also better than the text
is 8. d6 cracking at the white center, though succumbing
to the shot 9. Qa4!.}
9. Bd2
{Giving up the two bishops for an advantage in time.}
9. Nxd2 10. Nbxd2 Ne7?
{Moving an already-developed piece once again. One may
be thinking it's attacking the bishop so it's all right,
but in this position due to black's open king and his
newly undefended bishop, Tim came up with a tactic that
gains considerable advantage while eliminating black's
right to castle. It must be said, however, that if Black
continues correctly he could establish a strong knight
at d5. However, in the opening, there usually isn't
time for these kind of maneuvers. Tim suggested 1. 0?a5
or 10. g5 as creating counterplay for Black. He didn't
provide the line for 10, g5 which leaves me speculative,
but I agree with 10. a5 for sure. Though 10. g5 11. a3 Ba5
12. Nh4 Bxd2+ (if 12. gxh4, then mate in two with 13. Qh5+!)
13. Kxd2 g4 does look good for black now that I take a second
look.}
11. Bf7+! Kxf7 12. Qb3+ Ke8?! 13. Qxb4 a5?
{This move does not help development nor does as much
constructive work as it would've done on move 10. This
is black's first major mistake. Tim mentioned to me that,
"13. b6 was undoubtedly the best move because 13. d6
fails due to the fact it opens up the position while the
black king is in the center and 13. d5 obviously fails
because it produces the well-protected passed e-pawn
that's ready to push after 14. 0-0 and 15. Rfe1. 13. b6
is the only solid way to develop because white's pressuring
black to a huge extent due to the powerful center built up."
I agree. 13. b6 followed by 14. 0-0 Bb7 15. Rfe1 Nd5
(hopping into the fine outpost blockading the advance of
the d-pawn) and black doesn't stand as badly.}
14. Qc4 d5 15. Qc3 f4?!
{Black really was in time trouble which is why, I think,
that these blunders are occurring in a row like this.
Nothing called for an immediate 15. f4. Better was the
slow buildup with 15. Rf8.}
16. Rc1?!
{Keeping the initiative going. White probably should've
castled first and played Rfe1 in order to get the e-pawn
rolling right away.}
16. c6 17. 0-0 Rf8?
{Giving white everything he could want. Straying from
anything logical. White has so many threats right now,
that one would think black would need to defend against
a few. 17. Qb6 is a much stronger move to the text with
pressure down the b-file and on white's center.}
18. Rfe1
{Continuing his plan.}
18. h6?
{Tim said to me in an email, "18. h6? was a computer-like
move that intends 19. g5 and prevents white playing Ng5.
To tell the truth, I was expecting either 18. a4
(preventing Nb3-c5) and Qc7 intending a c5 push after due
preparation or 18. Kf7 manually creating a castled position.
After 18. h6 I knew he's not able to create a safe place
for his king for the rest of the game." I believe that
18. h6 was a rather inaccurate move as well. More
active were the ones that Tim indicated and 18. Rf5!?.}
19. Rcd1
{The main idea here is to over protect the base of white's
center (d4) to allow the white knight at d2 to make it's
way to c5. Even better was probably 19. Re2 (to allow the
knight retreat to e1-d3-c5 if the opportunity arises itself)
g5 20. h3 (now intending Nh2-g4 and eliminating all black
counterplay) Rg8 21. Nh2 and white has a great game. The
text has the drawback of allowing black to create something
on both wings.}
19. Bf5
{Developing his bishop, but allowing 20. Nb3 without problems.
Better was 19. g5.}
20. Nh4?!
{Tim mentioned to me that this move was mainly due to time
pressure because he blitzed this one out. He admitted,
"I missed the stronger line 20. Nb3 b6 21. Nc1 g5 22. Ne2 Rc8".}
20. Bg4 21. Rc1 g5
{21. Be6 was more useful than the text at this point
because it blockades white's strong e-pawn.}
22. Nhf3
{This proves that white knew he made a mistake because he
had nothing else in store for this knight here.}
22. Bf5?
{This move didn't impress me. Much more logical would be
22. Rg8 or 22. Be6 (again, blockading the passed e-pawn
and getting out of the way for g4).}
23. h3
{A useful move. It makes g4 less tempting and allows for
Nh2. A nice idea.}
23. b6 24. Qa3!
{Changing direction to the weak d6 square.}
24. Rc8?
{Not the way to respond, much too defensive. However,
there are immediate concerns that need to be considered
like the h-pawn and a cancer spreading in his own territory!
 Better was 24. Be6 or 24. Qd7.}
25. Qd6!
{Excellent move. The queen radiates her majesty's powers
in all directions making black extremely uncomfortable.
Black has nothing except defense now.}
25. Bg6 26. Nh2!!
{Beautiful! I was proud of my friend here and surprised.
He thought for 10 minutes in a 90 minute game on this move.
This is a Karpov-type move when he's more of a calculating
player. Here he's bringing more pieces into the battle.
Heading for f6 while his counterpart heads for f3.}
26. Kf7!
{A fine defensive move as well. It makes sure the bishop
stays put and tries to find safety. If Black tried the
resource 26. h5, Tim told me he planned 27. Ndf3 which
would be a strong response. What made the white queen
at d6 so powerful is that it couldn't be exchanged without
the loss of a piece and a powerful white passed pawn at e7.
After 26. Kf7! now exchange is possible.}
27. e6+
{The in between move. White realizes he needs to retreat
his queen, but he wants to push the passed pawn to be a
thorn in black's flesh first. Strong alternatives to the
text were 27. Ng4 threatening 28. Nxh6+ and 27. Ndf3! Kg7
28. Ng4 Nf5 , and then 29. Qa3 retreating and White has a
strong attack going. As a matter of fact, the latter
alternative looks stronger than the text.}
27. Kg8 28. Qa3?!
{White should've just retreated to e5 on his 28th move.
It creates more threats. In post game analysis, Tim
 mentioned to me what he was thinking during the game here,
"At this point I was nervous. I said to myself, 'what
have I done'. Here black had a brilliant defense, 28. Bf5!
followed by 29. Kg7 and black solidifies." In a post-mortem
28. Re8 also looks interesting for black.}
 28. Qc7?
{This neglects the g4 square as well as all the other
important squares on the kingside. He's intending c5,
but I don't know what that does for him.}
29. Ndf3! c5??
{Again, I don't understand what this does for Black.
Much better is 29. Bf5. All this does is opens up a
diagonal for the white queen after the capture at
 c5. This is a game-losing blunder.}
 30. Ne5?!
{This is a good move, but it's not the best. 30. Ng4!
is a powerful shot that gives white the winning game and
after 30. Kh7 31. dxc5! (a clearance capture for use of
the a1-h8 diagonal) bxc5 32. Qc3 he has a powerful attack.
 He saw this immediately in analysis afterwards, but during
the game, with //time ticking down, he missed it. With the
knight moving to e5 it's not doing it's job of preventing
h5 anymore.}
30. Be8 31. Qd3?
{Not punishing black fully. Thanks to the d5 pawn the e7
knight (black's elastic blockader), the b1-h7 diagonal
doesn't have much promise for the white queen. 31. Nhg4!
once again would be indicated. The text gives black
some hope for counterplay by locking up the pawns and
attacking the praised passed e-pawn with 31. Rf6!.
This would've been a sure win for white.}
31. Qd6
{31. Rf6! is a much stronger way to attack the e-pawn
while protecting the h-pawn. Also possible here would
be locking up the pawns with 31. c4!.}
32. Qa6?!
{Having to make the last few moves with about 30 seconds
each, Tim picked the less accurate of his three logical
choices here. The important strategy here is the use of
the a1-h8 diagonal and that's done by exchanging. 32. dxc5!
was a fine move. Any other moves allow 32. c4! Locking
up the pawn structure and making use of the a1-h8 diagonal
a thing of the past.}
32. c4! 33. b3 c3
{Of course not 33. Qxe6 because of 34. Nxc4!.}
34. Qd3
{34. Nhg4 is the strongest in the position.}
34. Qb4 35. Nhg4!
{This is still a strong move, but it's effect has diminished
over the past few moves. Stronger yet would seem to be
35. Nd7!}
35. Kg7 36. Nd7 Rh8?!
{After the game, Tim pointed out to me here a much stronger
defensive opportunity. 36. Bg6! Prevents any penetration
by the queen and after 37. Qa6, then 37. Rfd8 and black's
still pretty solid.}

37. Qa6!
{Even better might be 37. Qe2! Qxd4 38. Ngf6 c2 39. Rxc2
and White has an excellent game.}
37. Rc6 38. Qa7?
{Here, white made haste quickly, answering with 38. Qa7
after 30 seconds of thought. This isn't a bad move at
all, but much stronger in the position is the move 38. Nge5!.}
38. c2??
{Not punishing White in the least. Far superior is 38. Qd6!
With pressure on White's passed e-pawn. Now white has a won game.}
39. Ndf6!
{Nothing short of beautiful. A discovered attack (and pin)
on the defensive horse at e7 and new pressure on black's
bishop at e8. Tim's always quick to see strong tactics.}
39. Qd6 40. Nxd5!!
{Pretty. Utilizing the overworked queen and adding another
attacker to the pinned knight.}
40. Kf8
{Forced. Anything else loses terribly. This move releases
the pin and protects the knight once more.}
41. Nxe7
{This is a fine move. I thought it was the best in the
position until Tim pointed out in post-game analysis
41. Re5!! This move is a very beautiful move that rips
the game open tactically all over the place.}
41. Qxe7 42. Qb8
{Intending 43. Qe5 with centralization.}
42. Kg7??
{Time pressure caused the game-losing blunder. Begging
white to play what he had originally intended to win
material. Better was 42. Qd6.}
43. Qe5+! Kg8?
{Still losing, but better, is 43. Kh7.}
44. Nf6+! Kf8
{Still losing, but better again, is 44. Qxf6.}
45. Nxe8!
{Another discovered attack. He's unleashing them one after
the other.}
45. Rg8 46. Qf5+
{Even better is 46. d5!, though white is still winning
undoubtedly.}
46. Kxe8 47. Qb5 Qd6
{47. Kf8 was better than the text.}
48. d5?!
{The more direct win was 48. Rxc2!!. The rest of the
game is self explanatory. In a few cases, Tim didn't
take the most efficient way to win or utilize the quickest
checkmate possibilities, but he was going at about 25
sec. on average per move towards the end.}
48. Ke7 49. Qxc6 Qxc6 50. dxc6 Rc8 51. Rxc2 Rc7 52. a3 h5

{00043.6.07 Analyzed by Expert Tim Smith}
1.e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4
{This is the Philidor Defense with some unusual lines.
3. Bc4 is perfectly all right, but 3. d4! offers much
more possibilities. This is an opening where white can
get a big advantage in the center if black's not careful.
The first way to get an advantage was to play 3. d4.
Again 3. Bc4 is playable.}
3. Bg4?!
{Not the best choice in opening lines. It brings the queen's
bishop out much too early. The simple 3. Be7 or 3. Nc6
would've sufficed. Also, the strong 3. c6! is a great
way to take advantage of the fact that white didn't play d4
by intending d5 himself with a strong mobile center.}
4. h3?!
{Some masters of the past have tried this, but with not much
success. This pin is not very strong at all. There's no
need to immediately tickle it with h3. Still attempting to
build up your center by 4. c3 and then d4 was a more
preferable choice. Also, played here has been 4. Nc3 with
pressure on d5.}
4. Bxf3?
{A mistake. The bishop should've backed up to h5. Now white will get a
strong opportunity to attack the weak f7 point.}
5. Qxf3 Nf6?
{Definitely bad. Much better is 5. Qd7! When the weak b-pawn
can be defended by c6.}
6. d3?!
{You have sound development, but you're not being aggressive
enough! 6. Qb3! Continued the strong attack (very similar
to Morphy - Duke of Brunswick in the Philidor's Defense)
and punished black for the mistakes of early development
of the queen's bishop and poor motive for exchanging the bishop.}
6. g6?
{Bad, once again, due to the fact it leaves the knight poorly
protected (in the short term) and the bishop has nothing to
contribute to the game from that closed diagonal (long term)
unless a center break would occur. Better was mending the
wounds with 6. Nc6 or, in fact the aggressive 6. c6 once
again, intending d5 when the situation permits or queenside
expansion with b5.}
7. Bg5!
{Development with tempo. Nice.}
7. Bg7 8. Bxf6?! Bxf6
{Why exchange when your bishops are excellent?}
9. Nd2
{This move is good development. It leaves open the option
of playing c3. The other plan would involve the d5 square
with 9. Nc3.}
9. 0-0
{You don't want to commit your king until the center is
defined and you have no weaknesses (g6 is your weakness
here). 9. Nd7 or 9. c6 immediately would be indicated.
Now the powerful attack on the h-file and a castle queenside
can occur. Good strategy would involve confusing your
opponent so he doesn't find the correct strategy right away.}
10. 0-0-0
{Not bad at all! Slightly better still would be getting
the h-pawn rolling immediately with 10. h4!. 10. c3 could
still successfully be played now to intend a center break.}
10. Nd7
{A decent developing move. However, an attack on the wing
can't beat a counterattack in the center. 10. Nd7 isn't
the most forcing. Better is 10. c6 once again leaving open
b5 or d5 if it's allowed.}
11. h4!
{This begins to attack the g6 weakness and attempts to open
the h-file. I'm impressed that each side saw the tactics
involved in a casual yahoo game. Of course, now not 11. Bxh4?,
then 12. Qh3! (with an x-ray attack on h7) c6 13. Qxh4 Qxh4
14. Qxh4 and a decisive material advantage with still some
hope for attack on the h-file.}
11. Bg7
{Required is a central counterattack with 11. c6, there
might follow 12. h5 g5 13. Kb1 b5 14. Bb3 Nc5 and white
has his own problems.}
12. h5 h6? 13. hxg6!
{Very nice. The opening of the h-file is deadly, while the
f7 pawn is being massacared.}
13. Nf6?
{Other moves also lose. 13. Qf6 14. Bxf7+! Kh8 15. Qh3 Rfd8
16. Qe3 and white's obviously winning. If 13. Qe7, then
14. Bxf7+! Rxf7 15. gxf7+ Qxf7 16. Qg3 and white's winning.}
14. Rh2?!
{Here you missed 14. Bxf7+ with a won game. However, you
still have a strong kingside pressure.}
14. d5
{Good defense! Counterattacking in the center is the way
to refute a wing attack.}
15.exd5?!
{Here you missed the intermezzo check with 15. gxf7+! Which
opens the crucial diagonal to the black king. After
15. gxf7+, then 15. Rxf7 16. exd5 Qd6 17. Qg3! (threatening
Rxh6) and you have a winning initiative.}
15. fxg6 16. d6+
{16. Qg3 was preferable and much more threatening, followed
by 16. Kh7 17. Rdh1 Nxd5 18. Ne4 with threats of Ng5+ hanging
in the air. This position would be very uncomfortable for
Black.}
16. Kh8 17. Rdh1
{In this position also, 17. Qg3 would make Black pay the piper
quicker.}
17. cxd6 18. Qxb7 d5??
{This loses outright. Much, much better where black is still
in the game is 18. h5. Now White can play the strong rook
sacrifice 19. Rxh6+ Kg8 (if Bxh6 it's mate in a couple)
20. Rxg6 Rf7 (the only move) 21. Rh8+! Kxh8 22. Qxf7 Qg8
23. Rxf6 and white has an easily won game.}
19. Bb5?
{Definitely a blunder. The rook sacrifice wins more than a
piece for nothing. This gives black real counter chances.
For instance 19. Ng4! which snatches back the initiative
and protects all of white's threats or the text.}
19. Rb8 20. Qa6?
{Once again, 20. Rxh6+ would seem to be in order. Now black
has the advantage.}
20. Rb6?!
{Black doesn't capitalize immediately which he could've done
with 20. Ng4! followed by 21. Qg5 with advantage.}
21. Qa4 Ng4??
{Of course, this just loses a piece now that the white queen
is on a4.}
22. Qxg4 Rxb5???
{21. Ng4 DID lose a full piece. The reason is because 22. Rxb5
leads to a forced mate! Definitely required here was 22. Rxf2
and black is still barely hanging on, though a piece down.
White can force a checkmate with 23. Rxh6+! Kg8 24. Qxg6 Qh4
25. R1xh4 Rxf2 (there's nothing else) and 26. Rh8 Checkmate.}
23. c4??
{A grave error, not winning the game at the earliest moment.
In fact, this once again gives Black counterchances.}
23. dxc4???
{Another blunder. 23. Rb6 was a required move here. White now
has the same forced mate mentioned before. 24. Rxh6+ Kg8
25. Qxg6 Qh4 26. R1xh4 Rxf2 27. Rh8 Checkmate.}
24. dxc4?
{Turning the tables towards black once again. This game's
becoming a see-saw action.}
24. Rc5?
{Once again, giving white a mate opportunity, though it's
very detailed calculation. 25. Rxh6+! Kg8 26. Qxg6 Rxc4+
27. Nxc4 Qg5+ 28. Qxg5 Rb8 29. Rh7 Rb7 30. Qd8+ Kf7
31. R1h6 Rxb2 (nothing else) 32. Nxe5 for the beautiful
checkmate.}
25. b4??
{Not playing through the winning line once again.}
25. Rc7?
{Allowing 26. Qxg6!.}
26. c5?
{This gives black hope again. This appears to be toying
of emotions.}
26. a5??
{ ADDED!!!!!
Still allows white to take on g6. Observe: 27. Qxg6 Rff7
28. Ne4 Qf8 29. Ng5! Rxc5+ 30. Kb1 Rc1+ (every single other
legal move on the board is mate very interestingly!)
31. Kxc1 Qc8+ 32. Kb2 Rxf2+ 33. Kb3 Kg8 34. Rxh6 a4+ 35.
Ka3 Qc3+ 36. Kxa4 Qc2+ 37. Qxc2 Rxc2 and the b-pawn marches
forward for the checkmate. This calculation is less
impressive then it looks. There are almost all checks
or forcing moves involved and it's much easier to calculate
deep variations with forced moves involved.
27. Qe6??
Handing his opponent counterchances again.
27. axb4 28. Rxh6+
Finally seeing the move that was begging to be played
forever. Still, 28. Qxg6 was still more forcing.
28. Bxh6 29. Rxh6+ Rh7 30. Qxe5?
30. Qxg6 adds to the pressure and doesn't let black slip
in more defensive opportunities.
30. Rf6??
This hands the game to white again. 30. Qf6 was black's
only chance.
31. Rxh7+?!
Missing the punishment for Black's last move which is 31. Rxg6!.
31. Kxh7 32. Ne4 Rf5 33. Qh2+ Rh5 34. Qf4 Rh1+ 35. Kb2 Qd4+
36. Kc2???
Losing the game to an accidental forced mate.
36. Qd1+! 37. Kb2 Qb1 Checkmate 0-1
This was a topsy turvy game that I'm assuming was due to
time trouble on yahoo. You both play rather decently through
the opening, though some lines were less than the best
choice of theory. However, you need to work on tactics
and exploiting weakening moves by your opponents king.
Overall a good game.

{I am going to assume that you are familiar with the
Opening you are playing. It is interesting that it
has taken so many twists. That is why I think that 1.
d4 openings are so fun! At this point it begins to
look like Black does not know how to transition into a
playable middle game. The QB is going to be a
liability. A "bad" Bishop. Black should have played
10...b6. Missing this idea insures that from here out
the Black position will deteriorate.}
11. Bd3 Nf6 12. 0-0 Bd7 13. Ne5
{With the "Bad" QB at d7 the e5 square is as secure as
it can be in a chess game. Consider the stronger idea
of 13. Qc2 and building pressure along the c - file.
By missing this, you almost allow Black into the game.
 Some fancy footwork on the Kingside rescues the game
from oblivion. Black's passive play also helps. On
13...Qc7, 13...Qe7, and 13...Rc8, the idea is to play Rc1
and b4 with an eye on playing e4 / c5. This position
is theoretically won for White. However turning
theory into a solid point is a different matter.}
13...Qc7 14. Qf3 Qb6
{Black is passively straying from anything that
resembles an idea. Time to tighten down the
thumbscrews!}
15. Rc2 a5
{Once again Black chooses a passive move. Personally
I think that 15...c5 is black's last chance at gaining
an active game at the cost of a pawn. The fun part of
this idea is that Black should gain a passed but
isolated d - pawn. With the Queen's on the board it
looks awfully drawish. But before we awfulize Black's
play, remember that this is probably a matter of
personality. Personally, I'd rather fight in the open
than get trapped like a rat in a corner. Black does
not give White anything to think about. However, that
is a strategy that almost works. It is hard to stay
focused when the opponent wonders aimlessly. The test
is to know when the opponent is "baiting" or
"shoulding." ("Oops, I SHOULD have done that, no wait
maybe I SHOULD do this...") You learn the difference by
reading the board, not by believing your opponent.}

your problem. This move slyly turns the game around
almost instantly begins to give Black possibilities.}

{Ouch. O.K. you have the idea of what you want to do

instance 24...Rxb2 should give Black counter chances and
hope that liquidation will bring peace. 25. Nxd7 Rxd7
26. Rxc6 dxe4.}
24...Be8
{A vary Karpovian idea! I like it. The position
feels dead even at this point.}
25. exd5 exd5
{Interesting choice. This position is worthy of
further consideration and debate. I think that Black
capture with the "wrong" pawn. Consideration: the
"backward" (read weak and undefendable c - pawn), the
shattered pawn structure, the give away of the e -
file. On the other hand Black does free the entombed
Bishop - it's still "bad" but it is free. However
this is an ugly choice for Black to make. The other
way would surrender the c - file and lose control of
c7 after Qa5! Which is worse? "Wisdom is proved
right by her children."}
26. Qe3 Rb8
{An interesting confusion of the position can occur
after 26. Rxb2. At this point Black has no play,
having drifted back to passive wondering. After the
trades, Black has the R,B, + P - vs - Q. Did I
mention the Bishop was "bad?"}

 45. Bxe8+ Kd8 46. Kg2
{Possibly stronger is 46.Qxg7. It defends against the
check and sets up the Q/R mate on the back rank. If
46...Qe7, White enters the end game with the
overwhelming odds of plus B and 4 pawns. If 46...Kxe8
47. Re2+ Qe5, it's mate in three. If 47...Kd8 48. Qg8+
Kc7 50.Qf7+ and White invest the Rook for Black's
leading lady. Here is personality at work. I prefer
to go into crushing endgames when I get the chance.
Remember "Chess 101." First, gain a winning
advantage. Next, trade into oblivion. Always,
squelch counter play. The quickest and surest way to
do this is to nail the opponent down to a hopeless end

{00045.6.09 Analyzed by Master Daniel Waite}
1. g1-f3 f7-f6
{This is a major opening error.
This pawn move does not aid in development and blocks
the best King Knight move. It does not develop a
piece. It does not control central squares (1...f5 for
instance does). It creates weakness on the Kingside.}
2. b1-c3 c7-c6 3. d2-d4 d7-d5 4. c1-f4
{Interesting and "correct." Unfortunately "correct"
in chess is not always the "best." When an opponent
is cobbled up like this ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK! Here
4.e4 leads to a significant advantage due to White's
central control and Black's lack of development.}
4...b8-a6 5. h2-h3 {"Lasker's rule" states: "Always
distrust a pawn move." The reason is that all pawn
moves change the game, forever. You can move any piece
back and forth, but when a pawn moves it can't go
back. Thus you see the permanent nature of the pawn
move. Many players in your class tend to be afraid of
"shadow" threats (...Bg5). Silman's rule is "if you see
a threat, look for a way to ignore it." Lasker urged,
"defend with as little effort as possible." Typically
this pin is an illusion, especially before a person
castles. It's only real purpose is to control the
dark squares on the Kingside (and possibly the
center).}
5...h7-h6 6. a2-a3 {Having protected the Kingside,
you now seal off the Queenside. While this seems
prudent you must remember a simple idea. Now repeat
after me, "always play in the center." Remind
yourself that if you do not play in the center you
will spend eternity attempting to win the E class at
your local tournament. It is a simple concept, but it
is amazing how few of us catch on to it. Only play on
the side if there is a GM approved reason.}
6...g7-g5 7. f4-d2 {Not bad but it is a waste of a good
move. Why did you put your bishop on f4 to begin
with? To control the middle? To control the
Queenside? Well, then what is it doing on d2? You
have just wasted a good wish (to get to move twice in
a game - here was that extra move you wanted). If you
were to play Bg3/h2 then you could still do the
control thing.}
7...e7-e6 8. e2-e3 c6-c5 {Count the pawn moves
your opponent has made so far. Because the game
remains closed Black survives 60 moves longer than he
should have. When you see this many pointless moves
from your opponent, show no mercy. Go after him,
sacrifice material to open lines if you have to.
These are easy points!}
9. f1-b5+ c8-d7 10. b5xa6 {Interesting choice. I
like it. It creates some interesting possibilities on
the Queenside.}
10...b7xa6 11. d4xc5 f8xc5 12. b2-b4 {Fingers
off the wing pawns!}
12...c5-d6 13. d1-e2 {Again missing the chance to crack
the game open with 13.e4}
13...d7-b5 14. c3xb5 a6xb5 15. e2xb5+ {Good
exchange idea!}
15...d8-d7 16. f3-d4 a7-a6 17. b5xd7+ {I'm not
a fan. Typically when you are up the idea is to avoid
exchanges in favor of building pressure. Then there
is the idea that once a material advantage is obtained
trade into oblivion. It takes experience to know
which to employ and when. The key to this is to know
how to win an endgame. When you can go into a "won"
endgame, but all means go for it! The fewer pieces in
the middle game the easier the defense - typically.
This move shows lack of confidence. If you lose make
sure it is not due to lack of courage (Tal, if I
remember correctly.)}
17...e8xd7 18. o-o? {Allowing Black to equalize
immediately. Black has all sorts of weaknesses and
while you can castle you do not have to castle! I
know we preach that you should castle as soon as
possible but that is only part of the idea. The
complete context is to castle as soon as safely
possible with a reason. In other words, play with the
end in mind. Play with a plan. What does the
position demand? 18.Bc3! attacks Black's confused
Kingside.}
18....g8-e7 19. a1-e1 e6-e5 20. d4-f3 e7-f5?
{Black gives up the initiative. ...Rac8 is the move.}
21. e3-e4 d5xe4 22. e1xe4 h8-e8? {Giving
White more targets than can be possibly covered.}
23. c2-c4 {Another good idea is 23. g4.}
23...a6-a5 24. c4-c5 {Excellent. I like how
Silman encourages, "when you see a threat, look for a
way to ignore it!" Now you have the luxury of
ignoring further threats.}
24...d6-c7 25. d2-c3 {b5 gives White two passed
pawns and serious attacking potential on the
Queenside. For instance Bd1 then B anywhere....}

31. a3-a4 d8-b8 32. a4-a5 b8-d8 33.

{Coaches Advice: Your road to chess improvement is
through Karpov and his type. You must become addicted
to "positional" chess. You attacked when you should
not have, you traded when you should not have, and you
castled when you had a much better move. Study
Silman's "How to Reassess your Chess" (easily the most
useful book on chess in the last 200 years), "The
Amateur's Mind," and "How to... Workbook." In a sense,
I'm asking you to go back to "square one" and relearn
the game. The idea is to teach you to play with a
plan. It is said that a "bad" plan is better than no
plan. When I say plan, it's not a legalism that
controls every thought. But there are some basic
ideas like knowing when to attack and when to defend
that are critical. The cool part about this is once
you have the positional ideas down, you can attack
like a mad dog when the position calls for it. If you
don't know then you will not pull off the brilliant
attacks when they are available.
One piece of advice that will add 200 points to your
playing strength right now. ALWAYS (unless there is a
specific GM approved reason) PLAY IN THE CENTER! If
you lose the center, you lose the game. The center
controls the game. The center is your brain, you lose
your brain.... OK you get the picture. You will be
surprised when you get this one concept down with a
passion that you will be able to play with anybody.
(Or at least you will get that feeling.) You will
also be a legitimate threat to anyone (just don't look
at the rating, it messes with your mind).
While you are doing this, consider what openings you
do well when playing. While 1.Nf3 is a very good
opening you must understand the ideas behind what you
are attempting to accomplish with it. Many players
are looking for a win in the first 10 moves. If this
is you then 1.Nf3 is not our opening. If you are real
good at endgames then your best route is probably 1.e4
(assuming you can live through the typically violent
middle games). If you like positional chess then head
for the closed games you find in 1.Nf3, 1.c4, 1.d4.
1.f4. If you really like odd ideas stick to 1.c4
(English) and 1.f4 (Bird) but I wouldn't stray beyond
those (possibly 1.Nc3 the Dunst is playable.) The
reason for this advice is that many players like an
opening, for whatever reason, and do poorly in it
(typically because they 1. Do not understand it. 2. Do
not feel comfortable in the game. 3. Are not capable
of grasping the concepts). For instance, I attempted
to play the Modern Benoni and was constantly beaten.
My problem is that I did not have the maturity in the
areas that were necessary to play the opening.
Nothing personal, but the Benoni lived up to its name
(son of my sorrow). Meanwhile they rule with an
opening that they, for whatever reason, do not like.
I used to play the English but abandoned it for more
popular openings. A while back I did an inventory and
discovered that I did well in English type positions
and won 80% of my games. So when I'm in an important
game that I want to win, what opening do I play?
(Hint: It's not 1.e4!)}

 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3.Nd2
 Nf6 4.Bd3 c5!
{I'm going to leave the theoretical debate to the
Opening experts. However, White's move is not bad.
Logically White should play e5.}
 5.exd5 exd5
{The text keeps the game even. 5...cxd4 is stronger due
to the establishment of a strong center pawn. The
move that is tempting is 5...Qxd4. This leaves Black
with the two center pawns after 6. Ngf3 cxd4. For the
extra pawn, White leads in development. However, I
doubt that White can capitalize at this point.}
6.dxc5 Bxc5
{Natural. You might consider the placement of the QN
on d7 with 6...O-O 7. Nb3 Nbd7. Then on 8.Nxc5 Nxc5
leaves Black with an edge in control of the center.}
7.Qe2+ Be6 8.Ngf3 Nc6 9. O-O
 O-O 10. Nb3 Bb6
{A move that is very subjective. Personally I think
the Bishop belongs on d6. 10...Bd6 is much more
aggressive since the Bishop has plans for the
Kingside. Also the square f4 tends to be a key post
for White in the Tarrasch. The advantage of the
Bishop at b6 is that it freezes the Rook at f1.}
11. Bg5 Re8 12. Qd2 h6
{Brave. This move baits 13. Bxh6 when you have the
choice between 13...gxh6 and 13...Ne4. Unfortunately for
White the sac at h6 is not entirely sound.}
13. Bh4 Bg4 14. Qf4 Bc7
{White's move is not bad. The idea is to attempt an
"instant" endgame where White's pawn structure is
superior. Also it stops ...Qd6 which is a natural
freeing move and gives you plenty of opportunity to
lose material. You avoid these pitfalls. A stronger
consideration in this position would be the move
14...Bxf3. After 15. Qxf3 Ne5 Qf5 16. Nxd3 17.cxd3 the
possibility of 17...Rd2 comes close to working. 18. Nd4
Bxd4 19. Qxd4 Qd6. The question is which will be
stronger, the Bishop or the Knight. In the endgame
with pawns on both sides, the Bishop is favored.
However, White's pawns are just as ugly as yours and
the e-file and the second rank belong you. Unless the
opponent is an IRS agent...}
15. Qxg4 Nxg4 16. Bxd8 Raxd8 17. Bb5
{17. Rae1 or 17. c3 and the position is lifeless.
With Bishops of opposite colors it looks drawish.}
17. ... a6 18. Bxc6 bxc6 19. Nfd4 c5
{Ouch! You miss the second chance at gaining a
permanent advantage. 19...Bxh2 20. Kh1 Be5 21. Nxc6 (on
21. Rad1 then choose between ...Bxd4 and ...Rc8) 21...Bxb2.
Black has an extra pawn and White has a shattered pawn
structure. Black has a reasonable shot at winning the
end game.}
 20. Nxc5 Bxh2+ 21. Kh1 Bd6 (?)
{I agree with your "?" to a certain point. It does
offer the exchange that occurs in the game but that
does not really do you damage. About the only other
reasonable possibility would be 21...Be5 "forcing"
either 22. Rad1 or 22. c3.}
22. Nb7 Rd7 23. Nxd6 Rxd6 24. Kg1
{Sweet! This subtle idea invokes many possibilities.
Take some time to ponder this point.}
24...g6
{Ouch again. Try 24...Rb6. The Knight without a target
is only taking up space. I know the proverbial idea
of taking away the Knight's advance points but in this
case it opens the door for White to gain a comfortable
position. When you have positional justification -
ATTACK! The move ...g6 can be played later. The idea
is to inspire those Queenside pawns to move and weaken
themselves before your opponent can fix the a-pawn and
pick it off.}
25. Rad1
{O.K. Your GM returns the favor. 25. Rae1 grabs space
and almost wins the endgame by force. You might
benefit by the study of isolated pawn play. The
isolated pawn is safely blocked. Controlling the
e-file would cut off the support of the King. The
fatal attack on the blocked pawn must come either from
behind or beside the pawn. This can't be achieved
with the Rook on d1. It's unbelievable that a GM
would miss this move. You get time to set up an
adequate defense.}
25...Rd7
{Nice! This is about the only chance you have to
protect your weakness. White should now shift the
attention to immobilizing the a-pawn and finding a way
to pile up against it. The very real problem is going
to be that Black gets to stack the Rooks. Thus
White's response is "forced."}
26. Rfe1 Rde7 27. Rxe7 Rxe7 28. f3
 Nf6
{28...Ne3 is probably your last chance to win. However,
it's not likely that an advantage could be generated
off this move. It does confuse the race to the center
and Queenside and makes White's King unstable. The
idea is to follow it up with ...f4, ...f5 and the strong
pawn storm on the Kingside.}
29. Kf2 Kf8 30. Rd3 Rb7 31. Rb3
 Rxb3 32. Nxb3 Nd7
{Your opponent seems to be counting on the general
ignorance of endgames among the average population.
This move demonstrates a keen understanding of the
endgame. It keeps the King and opposing Knight from
penetrating. It prevents White from promoting a pawn
on the Queenside. Basically you kill the position.}

{Excellent game! You avoided your chances to lose
and have a game suitable for framing. You missed two
opportunities to win material but you controlled the
game well. Possibly the strategy of simplifying into
an end game will be your best chance of improving your
rating. Consider "instant" endgame openings -
assuming you have the patience to learn endgames
really well. Nunn's book on Rook & Pawn endgames and
Silman's Endgames are basic reading. BTW, against a
stronger opponent, I'm always looking for a way to
simply into a winning (or equal) endgame. It may be a
"boring" way to play but I've collected many scalps.}

{This is the King's Indian transposing into the Krause variation of the
Grunfeld Reversed. c5 is an aggressive move attacking your center. Dxc5 is playable if you get all your development done in quick fashion, but it's generally not good to surrender the center. Much more aggressive and to the point is c4 transposing into the Tarrasch variation of the Queen's Gambit which is a much more aggressive attacking line for you undermining his center.

Rather than the text, you should've considered playing 4. Be3 with the idea of fianchettoing your king bishop and retaining the extra pawn. Notice this will prevent black's king bishop from taking control of that powerful diagonal that you tried to get him off later in the game. After Bxc5, you played correctly by e3, but life's not easy for you. You have what is known as a pawnless center, meaning no pawns on the fourth rank. Your opponent's fifth move was a blunder. He should've continued with the more logical Nf6 once again.}
6. Nc3 Bd7 7. Ne5
{Generally, it's not a good idea to move the same piece twice in the opening, when you can bring the king bishop out and castle.}
Nc6 8. Nxd7 Qxd7 9. Na4? Bb4+
{Nxd7 is not a beneficial exchange for you because you're trading your knight for Black's bad bishop (bishop of the same color squares as his pawns are occupying). Na4 was an error because you can't chase the bishop off that diagonal and because it's never a sound idea to attack a piece that can move away unless it's for tactical reasons (decoy and deflection).}
10. c3 Ba5 11. b4? Nxb4?? 12. cxb4 Bxb4+ 13. Ke2 Nf6 14. f3 e5?
{Black has no merit for giving up a piece with 11....Nxb4; he simply gives you a material advantage. Castling is prime in importance in the opening to get your king to safety. After 13. Ke2, you are feeling the effects of 7. Ne5 (moving the same piece twice instead of preparing to castle via Be2 etc.) which you played earlier. Black should've castled on his 14th move rather than sacrificing another pawn for no apparent reason.}
15. Bxe5 Qe6 16. Bd4 0-0 17. Rb1 Ba5 18. Kf2 b5 19. Nc5
{Now you possess a half-open b-file with a rook controlling it and a powerful knight that cannot be chased away by pawns. Notice you put pressure on a pawn that can't move at the moment (his a6 pawn). That simply limits his rook's abilities to a passive defender.}
Qe7 20. Bd3 Rac8? 21. Nb3??
{20......Rac8 was an unwise move because it hung his a6 pawn, better for him was Rfc8. You could've taken advantage of his mistake by 21. Nxa6, where black responds 21.....Bc3 22 Rxb5 Bxd4 23 exd4 Qa7 24 Qa4, which wins two pawns and you have a much better position.}
Bb4 22. a3? Bd6 23. g3 Nh5? 24. Re1 f5? 25. Rc1 Rce8?
{22. a3 simply offered a pawn to Black which he could've taken on two
occasions to create two passed pawns. 23....Nh5 was poor by black because he could've and should've responded with 23....Bxa3, again creating the passed pawns. 24.....f5 was Black's second missed chance. 25.....Rce8 moved the same rook again when he should've simply responded with 25.....Rxc1.}
26. Nc5 Qg5 27. Rg1 f4 28. exf4 Bxf4? 29. gxf4 Qh4+? 30. Kg2 Nxf4+ 31. Kh1 g5 32. Bf2??
{Black should've played 28....Nxf4 instead. Then, 29.....Qxf4 would have been a much better continuation for black compared to 29....Qh4+. 32. Bf2?? just loses a piece to 32....Qxf2! in which he wins a piece back and has an attack going.}
32...Qh5?? 33. Bg3? Nh3? 34. Rf1 Re3? 35. Be2? Nf4
{32....Qh5?? was a simple blunder. He should've taken your bishop without a blink of an eye. Then, instead of 33. Bg3?, you should've played 33 Nxa6 Nh3 34 Rf1 Nxf2+ 35 Rxf2 Qf7 36 Rg2 h6 37 Bxb5, which wins two pawns. Black should've responded on his 33rd move with 33....Nxd3 34. Qxd3 Qxf3+ 35. Qxf3 Rxf3, keeping the game equal and trading down to an endgame where his passed pawns would've ruled the day (two pawn majorities and a passed pawn in the center). Then instead of 35. Be2?, you could've won another pawn via 35. Qb3 Kg7 36. Qxd5 Rfxf3 37. Be5+ Kh6 38. Rxf3 Rxf3 39. Nxa6. Another possible continuation that would win you a pawn might be 35. Qb3 Rexf3 36. Qxd5+ Qf7 37. Be4 Rxf1 38. Rxf1 Nf4 39. Qxf7+ Rxf7 40. Nxa6 with a good position to win the b-pawn as well.}
36. Bxf4 gxf4 37. Rg1+ Kf7 38. Rg4 Qe5? 39. Nd7! Qb2???
{38.....Qe5 was bad defense of the pawn for the reason you exploited in move 39. He should've played 38.....Ke7. 39....Qb2??? was a grave mistake in which you could've won the game by forcing checkmate in 8 moves via 40. Qxd5+ Ke7 41. Qc5+ Kd8 (If Kxd7 it's mate in 6) 42. Qc8+ Ke7 (forced) 43. Qxf8+ Kxd7 44. Qf7+ Kd6 45. Qc7+ Ke6 46. Rc6+ Kf5 47. Qxf4++ With perfect play by Black, you could've had a forced win in 8 moves.}
40. Rxf4?? Ke7 41. Rxf8?? Rxe2 42. Qg1 Rxh2+ 43. Qxh2 {forced}
Qxc1+ 44. Qg1 Qh6+ 45. Qh2 Qc1+ 46. Kg2 Qg5+?
{40. Rxf4? was a mistake because you could've had a forced mate. 41. Rxf8?? was an error because you could've simply won the rook with 41. Nxf8. 46.....Qg5+? was an error by your opponent because 47. Qg3 Qd2+ 48. Kh3 Qh6+ 49. Qh4+ Qxh4+ 50. Kxh4 Kxd7 51. Rf6 a5 52. Rf7+ Ke6 53. Rxh7 which results in captures to bring you to an endgame with you more than a piece up in material. He should've played 46.....Qd2+ keeping the captures to a minimum. The reason is because it's generally not good to trade down when you're behind in material because it will lead to a lost endgame.}
47. Kf2? Qd2+ 48. Kg3 Qg5+ 49. Kf2 Qd2+ 50. Kg3 Qg5+ 51. Kh3 Qh6+ 52. Kg2 Qd2+ 53. Kh1 Qe1+ 54. Qg1 Qh4+ 55. Qh2 Qe1+ 56. Kg2 Qd2+ 57. Kg3?? {Draw by 3-fold repetition.
You absolutely do not want to draw when you're ahead in material, though I can understand that it's hard to remember all the positions you've played twice after so many moves. You had a superior position in many instances in this game, but you should try to learn to exploit your opponent's weaknesses and open up your mind to tactical possibilities. Good overall game.}

{00048.6.18 Analyzed by Expert Tim Smith}
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. b4 cxb4
{The Sicilian Defense Wing Gambit Deferred is a rare line
in the Sicilian because both sides would end up with a
slightly poor position in their different respects with
long-term advantages siding with Black. The natural 3. d4
is a much better response for white increasing his advantage
in central space while not making any positional or tactical
compromises.
Now Black has two options. 1. He should try to retain
the extra pawn, which is not a difficult task to do in
this variation making it a slightly incorrect gambit
(not as bad as the Morra though) or 2. He should attempt
to gain development and initiative with Nf6 (the stronger
line - for details, look at annotation about move 4. Nf6).}
4. d4 Nf6 5. Nbd2 g6?! 6. Bb2? Bg7
{Immediately, White claims the black central squares as his
with 4. d4. He intends maximum piece deployment and speedy
development, while gaining space. Arguably, it's the best
move on the board.
4...Nf6 a move earlier, declining the gambit, was probably
a stronger opening line theoretically as opposed to the
accepting of the gambit. Typically the best way to refute
a gambit is to accept it as you did, but not if you can
gain so much time, development and static advantages in pawn
structure that you can create a won game before the opening
ends. Observe: After 3. Nf6, a line might be 4. bxc5 Nxe4
5. cxd6 Nc6 6. Bd3 (required in order to keep black's
advantage in time less felt and because the queen's bishop
can come out actively on b2, not requiring the movement of
the d-pawn) Nf6 7. Nc3 e5 8. d7+ Bxd7 9. 0-0 Bd6, and
you have an advantage in time (2 tempi as black!) with open
lines, attacking chances, and an advantage in pawn structure.
A master would typically consider those advantages unrealistic
with perfect play by white, but it's very achievable after
3...Nf6 in this opening variation which is a main reason
this line hasn't been analyzed in depth over the years.
But, since you accepted the gambit on move 3, 4. Nf6 was
a logical and required move.
I question your idea at move 5, not just the specific move
you made. It's not a bad idea certainly. A fianchettoed
bishop is needed in the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian
to coordinate a queenside attack, but in this precise
position, due to all the open lines not usually there as
well as a pawn you're now trying to hold on to, 5. e6 would
seem more logical setting up a Scheveningen-type formation,
the purpose being mainly to allow the queen's knight to
come out without being harassed, which otherwise would occur
by Bb5 and d5. Observe the resulting position after you
play 5. e6 with the following line: 6. Bd3 Be7 7. 0-0
0-0 8. Qe2 Nc6 9. Bb2 (mainly threatening 10. d5 with
the unleashing of a dangerous bishop harping on the king)
d5 in which you're successfully defending your b4 pawn
remaining a pawn ahead, while now possessing the c4 outpost
on your half-open c-file.
6. Bb2 was the first positional blunder by white. White
should've put the question to the limiting pawn by Rb1 and
an eventual a3 because it's not easy to defend it after your
faulty 5th move. Another reason it's important to eliminate
that annoying b-pawn is to allow him to advance to c4
increasing his spatial plus. The text is a move without
specific purpose. It's unclear yet where the queen's bishop
should reside. Also, later in the game in order to activate
that bishop, it requires giving up control of e5 with a pawn
as well as loses time by not attacking with the advance.}
7. Bd3 0-0 8. Qc1? Bd7? 9. d5 e6 10. Bc4 exd5!
{7. Bd3 is a typical developing move adding pressure
on the center. It isn't the best one, however. In this
position, e2 is a much better post for the bishop. The
advantage at e2 is one of avoiding the cramp that d3 entails
and the supporting eventual kingside expansion via h4-5
destroying black's fianchettoed position.
8. Qc1 was an extremely questionable move by your brother.
It doesn't seem to have any active plan associated with it
at all according to his next moves. I'm not sure whether
he played it to unpin a possibly pinned knight at f3, to
push the c-pawn (a good plan, but a bad first move to carry
it out), or to clear d1 for a different piece. Whatever
his initial thought was with that move, if he had any, he
didn't follow up. Much better is a3 or castling immediately,
which continue to undergo a plan. Observe the resulting
position after this line: 8. a3 bxa3 9. Rxa3 Nc6
10. 0-0 Nb4 11. Be2. Things look about as decent as
they can with white after his previous play.
8. Bd7 was your first major strategically related mistake.
D7 is the worst square for the queen's bishop. This is a
passive and hindering move as opposed to 8. Nd7 the ideal
move for the situation. Even 8. Bg4 had its own merit.
The reason 8. Nd7 would be preferred is because it allows
for the excellent queenside play including the moves: a6,
b5, Bb7, Qc7, Rc8, Nb6 following with Nc4 supported by the
b-pawn and heavy pieces on the c-file. Another major plus
of having the heavy pieces on the c-file is the pressuring
of white's backward c-pawn. Bd7 hindered the plan the board
wanted you to play.
9. d5 was a poor choice of move by white. First off, he
wrongly developed his bishop to b2 earlier in the game making
it a handicap that he's trying to get rid of now, secondly,
he's wasting time trying to activate it, lastly he gave up
control of the important e5 square with a pawn. Much better
was the obvious 9. 0-0.
It's good that you played by principle (opening up the
position when your opponent hasn't castled), but it leads
to a dead end since he can castle with one move at any
time. Better was Na6 trying to get your rooks into play
and protecting your pawn that you're trying to hold onto.
Instead of moving a piece twice in the opening by 10. Bc4,
white should've taken his "reasonable" opportunity to castle!}
11. exd5? Re8+! 12. Kf1 b5 13. Bd3 Nxd5 14. Bxg7 Kxg7
{11. exd5 was a poor move. 10. Bc4 would've been a tiny bit
more reasonable if he would've captured d5 with it. After
11. exd5 white's game starts to go downhill.
11. Re8+ is making powerful use of the e-file to white's
demise.
Still better than 12. b5 is 12. Na6 getting the rest of your
forces into the battle. Again, instead of 13. Nxd5, 13. Na6
was once again indicated. The "material advantage" after
what you played was only illusory and it also allowed white
to swap black-squared bishops weakening your king.}
15. Qb2+ Kg8 16. Be4 Bc6 17. Bxd5 Bxd5 18. Qxb4 Qf6
{15. Qf6 was preferable to the text.
Preferable to 18. Qxb4 was a3 still winning the pawn,
however also un-isolating the a and c pawns.}
19. Re1 Rxe1+ 20. Nxe1 a6 21. h4 Nc6 22. Qg4 h5
23. Qh3 Bxa2
{Much better than 19. Re1 was Qd4, because it attempts to
trade heavy pieces and gain the initiative after white
retakes with the knight because it compels black to do
something about the hanging pawn.
Instead of 21. h4, your brother should've looked to the
other wing of the board and played a4 attempting to isolate
your a-pawn after the trade.
Better than 22. h5 was Qa1 taking advantage of him not
retreating the Queen to b1 on his 22nd move.
23. Qh3 was an incorrect retreat. You shouldn't back
you queen into the edge. She needs to be centralized.
23. Qe2 was indicated, taking control of the open e-file
and preventing black's rook from doing the same. In
response, 23. Re8 (remember, chess is a team game!) was
better than 23. Bxa2.}
24. Qf3 Qxf3 25. Ndxf3 Re8 26. g4??
{24. Qa3 was better than the text because it's generally
a poor idea to trade pieces being down in material.
25. Re8 wasn't as forcing as the immediate Bc4+. You
were probably setting up the trap that white fell into,
but you should play the most forcing moves.
26. g4 was the game-losing blunder. White went two more
pawns down and could never recover. In case anyone was
wondering, the line to win the extra material would be:
26. Bc4+ 27. Kg2 hxg4 28. Nh2 Bd5+ 29. f3 gxf3+
30. Nhxf3 Nd4 31. Kg3 Rxe1 32. Rxe1 Bxf3 and white
loses two more pawns.
You both played very decently against one another for not
playing each other in 30 years. Some tips to remember are
not to blindly gain material when you can gain plenty of
time and development, develop a piece one time in the opening
to the best square (remember Bd7?), and try to work with your
strategical game a little bit. Good overall game.}
26...Bc4+!

1.e4 Nc6 2.Nf3

The center is important because if you lose the center then you lose the game.} 2...Nf6 3.Nc3 {Developing your pieces is good. Objectively this is not the best move but this develops good habits for the novice player.} 3...e5 {This is the move I like because it gains all sorts of space in the center. The move also prepares to attack on the Kingside because of the space that is gained there. 3...e5 Welcome to the "Four Knights". The reason we have these names is to help us identify common opening sequences. Once you learn these names then you can find them in books and study them until you know them. At this point, just enjoy the King hunt.} 4.Bb5 Na5 {This is a error. There are several reasons for this judgment. First, the Knight and the Bishop are of equal value. Your Bishop move does not really immediately threaten anything. Finally, the Knight on the rim is severely restricted in its movement. As you get better you will find exceptions to the rule for concrete reasons. But for now remember, "a Knight on the rim is dim."} 5.Nxe5 {Good! You removed the defender and now you pick up the piece.} 5...Bd6 {This is not a good place for the Bishop because it blocks the advance of the d-pawn. If the d-pawn is blocked then the Queen Bishop will have difficulty developing properly.} 6.f4 {5.d4 does the same thing and completes the control in the center. I distrust this move because if you castle Kingside the g1-a7 diagonal is open to all sorts of mischief.} 6...c6 7.Bd3 b5 8.Nf3 {This move is not correct. First, it gives back material ...Bxf4.

One of the basic move in the "how to humiliate your opponent 101" class. The idea behind this is repeated through the GM level.

7.Bxc4 Bb4
{This move makes sense but the Bishop does not belong
here in this set up. The Bishop will go to d6 and the
Queen Knight will plant itself on d7. The Queen Rook
will go to c8 and then Black will hammer the White
center with c5. The traditional idea is to get the
Rook to c2 and then stack the heavy pieces on the c -
file. This tends to be a very effective strategy for
Black. In essence Black wastes a move. This is a
common problem for computers. The machine generally
calculates without a long term plan.}
8. 0-0 0-0 9.Bd2 Nbd7 10.Ne2 Bd6
{Black is beginning to put the pieces where they
belong. White must now generate some offense.
Typically White will want to do one of two things.
White will want to launch a "minority" Queen side
attack using the two pawns supported by pieces against
the three Black pawns. The other idea is to simply
play in the middle. If we do a "point count" on the
central squares we get this: For White, on d5 = 1
point, on e5 = 2 points, on d4 = 3 points, on e4 =
zero points. Total = 6 points for White on central
control. For Black, d5 is attacked/controlled 3
times, e5 gains 2 points, d4 is good for zip, while e4
nets two more points. Total for Black would be 7
points. Thus Black has a slight edge in the center.}
11.Ng3 Bg6 12.Nh4
{While nothing is objectively wrong with this move,
I'd like to see something aggressive from my students.
 Personally 12.b4 and the beginning of the "minority"
attack looks appealing.}
12...Be4 13.Nxe4 Nxe4 14.Nf3 c5
{This is known as a "lever." The threatened exchange
forms an advantage at that spot for the one who
created it. Meanwhile the one who liquidates it
generally is at the disadvantage. Thus, Black will
want to create as much pressure on d4 and the c - file
before liquidating the lever. This is one of the
"subtleties" of pawn play. Another way to do this with
advantage would be to play 14...Rc8 first. For
instance, 14...Rc8 15.Qc2 Nxd2 16.Nxd2 c5 17.Ne4 Bb8
18.Rfd1 cxd4 19.Rxd4 Be5 20.Rd2 Qc7 21.Ng3 Nb6 22.Bd3
Qxc2 23.Rxc2 Rxc2 24.Bxc2 Rd8. And Black pulls off a
small advantage due to better central control and
active pieces.}
15.Bc3 Nxc3
{Interesting contradiction in chess ideas.
Technically White has managed to exchange off the
"bad" Bishop, almost unforced. Yet if it had been
allowed to exist on c3 then Black might have been
faced with a very dangerous threat down the a1 - h8
diagonal. Black's choice is a practical one but it
has an ugly down side. Assuming that Black makes the
trade of pawns at d4, to open the c-file, then White
will have two central pawns to Black's one. This
should help White to control the center in the long
haul.}

{Creating a long term weakness. There is a "hole"
at e5 and a "backward" pawn on e6. White should try
to immobilize the pawn on e6 then "stack the attack"
(a.k.a. the "HackStack Attack" for younger players) on
e6.}
20.e4
{White completely misses the opportunity. Not only is
this not good, it's close to a blunder. One of the
problems with the move, other than missing a golden
winning idea, is that it gives a center pawn away for
a less valuable f - pawn. The other problem is that
it flips the weak pawn possibilities if White
exchanges on f5. You must have been looking at a
concrete tactical idea at this point. However,
tactics do not work if you do not have positional
justification.}

{The computer finally reaches it threshold of pain and
does the only sensible thing. Nice job. Prescription
for improvement: First, your Endgame play is weak. As
you get stronger (and your opponents get stronger)
this will become a critical component of your game.
Also it is a way to clip stronger players, if you can
get to a superior Endgame. Most players focus on the
Opening and Middlegame but if you get to the Endgame,
you'll acquire a nice collection of scalps. Second,
either switch to playing 1. e4 (good idea if you are
under 1500) or burn the midnight oil on the positional
aspect of the game. This game was positional, and you
did well for the most part. If you can major on this
and become the most boring chessnut in your neck of
the woods, people will fear playing you. Once you get
the positional ideas down, then you can work on the
tactical. Generally the tactical aspect of the game
is easier because it involves learning patterns and
does not take much planning. It is one thing to
capitalize on an opponent's mistake, it is another
(much more satisfying event) to create the mistake
that leads to the wonder combination. If this doesn't
appeal to you watch a cat the next time it hunts. The
cat doesn't mind the time it takes to stalk its
prey. Nor does it have any scruples about playing
with its helpless opponent before turning it into
food. Just remember it's a game. When the cat's
target gets away, it just stretches and looks for a
shady spot for a nap. "Go thou and do likewise."
Finally, take the batteries out of the computer and
use it to hold something down. They are fun to play
now and then but they will not help your game. In fact
they will probably train you in some very bad habits.
With the availability of the Internet there is someone
available somewhere at all times to play.}

{This is playable, but 3. ... dxe4 would garner equality for
black. The reason why is that it breaks up white's center.
The two pawns abreast (e4 & f4) are strong.}
4. Nce2
{This is okay. Also worth consideration is 4. Nb1!?, with
the idea of a4, Na3-c4, with a good outpost for the knight.}
4... Nf6 5. e5
{This is the source of white's future problems. Pawns are
strongest when standing side-by-side. Therefore, 5. d3 is
better. The text move gives d5 for the black pieces. Also,
the advanced e-pawn is a potential target. Indeed, it was
attacked with ...f6 at a later point.}
5... Nd5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. d3 Bg4 8. Ng3
{Not much choice on this move. As you could see, allowing
8. ... Bxf3 9. gxf3 would be horrible. Doubled pawns that
have no mobility is almost like being down a pawn.}
8... f6
{! A nice move by crafty. White's center disintegrates,
and when the e-file is open, black can bring a major piece
(Queen or Rook) to the e-file, and use the hole at e3.}

12... Nxf4
{Typical of computers, black cashes in too soon. Getting
more pieces into the game with tempo (...Re8) is a much
better choice.}
13. Qf2 Kc8
{A strange move. Getting all of black's pieces into the game
would seem like the natural priority. Therefore, ...Qc7 and
...Rae8 looks more promising for black.}
14. Re1 g5
{This move or regrouping of the black pieces with ...Nd5 was
necessary, as white was threatening Nxd4 (a discovered attack
on the knight on f4 by white's queen and bishop.}
15. Be2 Nxe2+
{This move is dubious. The black knight was far more useful
that the white bishop. White was threatening Nxd4, but simply
...Qd7 would meet the threat.}
16. Rxe2 Qg8 17. Kb1 Qd5 18. h4
{Now black really wishes his king was on the 2nd rank. Then
in response to this move, he could simply play ...h6. But
because of black's incorrect method of development, white is
starting to take the initiative.}

{And naturally black resigned, considering that 50. ... Kd8
(forced) 51. Qc7+ Ke8 52. d7+ K moves 53. d8Q+ wins. You
made the best of your resources, but black could have had a
large advantage, mainly due to your allowing him to post a

12. d4 Be6 13. Qd1 Rfd8
{Passing on the creation of the isolated d-pawn (...cxd4) is good here. It shows mature thought, even if it was not intentional. We all learn to automatically filter some things by instinct. This is a time saver but must be deliberately challenged. In this filtering process we develop bias such as "labels." (e.g. ethnic and religious affiliations) These tend to put blinders on us. In chess, the basic teacher develops
a set of rules and presents them in lessons. This system of indoctrinating the student is good because they must be understood since violating them means terrible consequences. Having come to understand the basic filters and biases we then learn to develop "exceptions" and deeper understandings. It is the difference between following the Law and living by the Spirit. One such 'law' in chess is that the isolated pawn is a "bad" thing. Typically, if you know how to handle the position, the isolated pawn can be difficult from either perspective.
The fact that you either intentionally passed on this idea or unintentionally filtered the idea shows good potential. If it was an unintentional filter then you must focus energy on questioning these filters.}

{This is your "losing move." There is a fine line between a "great" player and a "good" player. Several distinguishing characteristics are important to note at this point. For instance the "great" player has in reserve a larger number of recognized positions (and the tricks that go with them). A "great" player also has the sense of when the position is critical. This is such a moment. Normally, I'd rail on this move but you had the courage to send in the game and learn something useful. Getting back to the idea of material, I like taking at a2. An interesting idea is ...Bd3. Once again, protecting the pawn is an illusion. Notice 23...Bxa2 23.Qxe7 Rb7 24.Qe4 f5 and once again
the Queen gets to watch from the side of the board. This Knight, in this position, loses effective influence on the center.}

{Coach's advice: For courage in allowing me to examine a lost game A+!
This shows a desire to actually correct faulty thinking processes. (If only I could have your thoughts as you were thinking them.....) So some ideas......
Challenge your filters. You seem to be unwilling to grab the pawn when it was available but unwilling to give up the pawn for a greater good (winning the Queen). Start paying attention to these filters and force yourself to look beyond these "laws" you have learned. The truth is on the board, not on a set of learned rules.
You show good positional judgment but do not seem to have good attacking
skills. The problem with good positional judgment is that if you focus here, it is not enough to win! Somewhere you must attack, even if it is "pawn picking." I'd suggest that you develop a "catalogue of positions." To do this get some cards or a notebook where you will record positions for games you play or see. Somewhere keep a "key" on the correct moves by category. Keep it as simple as possible. Maybe topics would include "sacrifice", "pawns", "king safety." Don't buy a book! You must do the work yourself, if a position strikes you
enough for you to take the time to record it then you are more likely to learn it for yourself.
I see that you are a "club" player. Clubs are fun and often good chess but..... The tendency is to play "cat and mouse" games with the other players minds. I'd suggest that you settle into three systems (two with Black and one with White) and play them regardless of who you play and what your opponent played last time. Here is the trick. You opponents will prepare for you, since you will be predictable, and will find the most difficult lines for you. That is good, they will test you and force you to grow and develop good lines. It will also force you to be precise in your opening moves. The idea is that you will have three openings that you know as well as anyone in the world and can play in any circumstance.}

{This is a wasted move because the primary objective of the opening is get your pieces to useful squares as soon as possible. Time can be a decisive, depending on how you use it.}
4. c3
{The Giuoco Pianissimo. The idea is to play a quiet controlled game.
Unfortunately many underestimate the potential of quiet moves and quiet
games. This is fine if you understand the options and what you are choosing. For instance 4.0-0 is strongest and 4.d4 is interesting. Also playable is 4.Nc3 but this leads down some very sharp lines.}
 4...Bc5
{I don't like this move. It certainly develops a piece but it does not stop the intended 5.d4. This gives White a target in the center, which means that time can be gained by attacking the Bishop.} 5. d4 {An interesting idea is 5.b4 but it is generally wise to play in the center unless there is a specific reason.}
 5...exd4 6. cxd4 Bb6
 {Again, Black does not help the cause in the center.
...Bb4+ is much stronger and because it puts pressure on the White center
(attacking a supporting pieces with a pin). Also notice that the Bishop has moved twice and is not necessarily useful at b6 in this position.}
7. b3
{Fasinating idea. The possibilities of playing Bb2 or Ba3 offer Black some potential headaches. I personally like 7.0-0 because another primary idea of the opening is King safety. Preparing to castle is one of those keys. Remember because you are ready to castle does not mean you have to castle but all things being equal, typically you will want to castle as soon as it is safely possible.}
 7...d6 8. O-O
{Now let me confuse you. A move earlier castling was strong but now it is not. There is a specific concrete reason for judgment. Black now gets to threaten the center by ...Bg4. This threatens the center because it posses the possibility of removing the defender on f3.}
8... Bg4 9. Bb2
 Nf6 {Once again, let me confuse you. Yes, this does develop a piece but there is a move that is stronger based on a concrete idea. 9...Qf6 creates more threats in the center than White can answer after ...Bxf3}
10. d5 Ne5 11. Bxe5
{So far the moves have been "natural" but it is time to make a decision.
This move gives up the Bishop pair (something I'm personally allergic too). Worse than giving up the Bishop pair is the lose of the pressure on the center. Lose the center, lose the game. Both Be2 and Bb5+ are stronger.}

unsound one. It's like you stopped believing in the truth to chase a
shadow. This allows Black to grab the initiative immediately. When
you are the cat and your opponent is the mouse - don't let him whistle
for the bull dog! Black is bottled up. This move frees Black's game and gives him considerable chances. }

{Coach's advice: I would push you to "open" your game up. You have a
 good defensive feel but you don't trust yourself. It's like driving a Mustang 35 mph in a 55mph zone. Part of what you need to develop is a "feel for when." When should you castle? When should you attack? This boils down to priorities and opportunities. For instance, if your opponent leaves a piece undefended your mind should think "target practice." That is opportunity. If your priority is to run like "Chicken Little" then go for it, just make sure the center is secure at all costs. You lost your grip of the center on several occasions.
Your opponent's final blunder was to lose control of the center. It doesn't take much, just focus. Be careful what you believe. You were safe but believed you were not and did not attack. You were unsafe but believed you were and attacked. You must learn to read the board, it alone is truth in the game of chess, not what you want, or fear, or hope.}

the position closed, and preserving the winning chances for white.}

5... Ng5
{Dubious. Now white can try 6. Nxg5 Qxg5 7. d4 (notice
this move causes the c1 bishop to hit the black queen) to
try to fight for the initiative. Instead 5. ... Nd6 would
give black equality with no problems. For example, 5. ... Nd6
6. Bxc6 dxc6 (to open up the diagonally for the light-squared
bishop) 7. Nxe5 Be7, with a very reasonable game for black.}
6. Nxe5 Be7 7. c3
{Why not 7. d4 straight away? Normally in Ruy Lopez, c3 is
needed to help get in the d4 push, but not here. There was
nothing preventing white from playing 7. d4 and 8. Nc3,
completing development.}
7... Nxe5 8. Rxe5 c6
{Here the computer does a strong multi-purpose move. ...c6
does the following: a) frees the black d-pawn to move (it was
pinned before) b) opens the a5-d8 diagonal for
the black queen, and c) helps establish a strong pawn center
on d5.}
9. Ba4 O-O 10. d4 d5 11. Bf4
{A natural move, but a little too mechanical. The bishop has
good scope on c1. White's best chance for an advantage is a
king-side buildup. Here, I would choose 11. Nbd2, with the
idea of Nd2-f1-g3 and Bc2, and you can see a lot of pressure
on black's king-side.}
11... Ne6 12. Bg3 Bd6 13. Re1 Bxg3 14. fxg3

have more than one pawn that can recapture take toward the
center. In this case, that would be 14. hxg3. The only
time you don't follow this principle, is something VERY
specific is to be gained by not doing so. Here, this opens
the f-line, but that leads to nothing. Also, this loosens
the g1-a7 diagonal. As we'll see later in the game, black
takes advantage of this fact.}
14... Qb6 15. Bb3 Bd7 16. Nd2
{A natural move, but this sets up black's sacrifice of a piece
for 2 pawns. Notice that if your pawn was on f2, black would
only get 2 pawns, because then the recapture on d4 wouldn't
be check, and you could defend your b-pawn.}
16... Nxd4 17. cxd4 Qxd4+ 18. Kh1 Qxb2
{Sometimes 3 pawns are worth a pieces, sometimes not. In this
case, black gets connected, passed (passed pawn = pawn
unopposed by enemy pawns), and MOBILE center pawns, so it's
worth it. If the black pawns had no mobility (such as if
they were blockaded), then it wouldn't be.}

Hi Everyone. Because the Kramnik-Deep Fritz. 7.0 match was

sharp, something not to Kramnik's advantage. 9...g4?! is suicide

Nxd5 12. cxd5 Nb4 13. Bb5+ Kd8 14. 0-0 g4 15. Qe2 Nxd5 16. Nh1
and Fritz would have good compensation in a highly tactical position.
The text is much quieter and better suited to a human vs. machine
match.}
6. Nh3 Nf6 7. e3 Bxc3 8. bxc3
{Now white has two bishops. The problem is the position is very
closed in nature, so the bishops will have little effect if the position
isn't opened up. Kramnik should be very happy after this exchange
as his knights could become very active.}
8...d6 9. Nf4 0-0 10. h4
{Kramnik mentioned that all the moves up to here were played
by the program very quickly, meaning most of this is probably
theory in the Fritz opening book. Here we should take stock. Fritz
just played a good move (10. h4) securing his f4 knight by
preventing the natural g5 advance by black. However, the f4
knight seems like white's only trump. The pawns on c3 an c4
are weak, black has the two knights in a closed position, and
white's king is in the center while black's is in safety. However,
the c4 pawn has the useful function of keeping the knight out of
d5 while the c3 fellow solidifies d4. White has a solid position,
but unless the bishops can be unleashed, black will have a slight
advantage.}
10...Qe7?!
{Kramnik should leave e7 for the knight. I suggest 10...Qe8 or
10...Ne7. The Qe8-f7 maneuver is very useful as it eyes h5 and
c4. 10...Ne7 allows black to play the prophylactic c5 to prevent
the freeing c5 move for white. For instance 10...Ne7 11. h5 c5!
12. Ba3 Qa5 etc. and black has a "very" comfortable game though
both Ng6 and Nh5 exchanging off f4 is prevented. Or if 10...Qe8!?
11. Ba3 Qf7 12. h5 b6 and if white plays the dubious 13. c5?!
anyway, then 13...bxc5 14. dxc5 d5! and the black bishop is shut
in and black has the superior center and now the e5 square.
After Kramnik's 10...Qe7 move Fritz can free himself.}
11. c5!
{One might think 11. h5 to be enough to secure the knight at f4 and
thus the game in general, but Fritz wants to trade off one of its
weak pawns while trying to open the position for his two bishops.
The a2-g8 diagonal is now open for the bishop or queen.}
11...Nd8!?
{Very nice! Let's examine the alternatives.  The greedy, 11...dxc5?
(opening the position willingly!) 12. Bc4+ Kh8 13. h5! and white
can open the h-file decisively for instance if the natural 13...cxd4??
then 14. Ng6+! hxg6 15. hxg6+ Nh7 16. Rxh7 Checkmate! If
11...d5 then 12. c4 simply and white has the better of it. 11...Kh8
was a reasonable alternative too, but the sacrifice with the text is
probably the best defense against a computer who can't resist
accepting!}
12. Qb3+ Ne6!?
{Possibly it's odd that black wants to get rid of his knight in a situation
favorable to knights. But he's willing to get rid of one of his knights
for the only active white bishop, the (soon to be) c4 bishop.}
13. Bc4 Re8 14. Ba3 Kh8
{Ignoring threats on the b-pawn. After the upcoming exchange,
white's only active bishop is gone and black has good counterplay.}
15. Bxe6 Bxe6 16. Qxb7 d5!
{The only move, but it still deserves an exclamation mark. This
ignores the threat on the c7 pawn as well. Positionally speaking,
this move is very effective at closing in the a3 bishop.}
17. Rb1!
{Wow. The first time I've ever seen Fritz decline a pawn. If Fritz
doesn't see a mate in the line or decisive material advantage then
he usually grabs material without second thought. However, here
he didn't see decisive material advantage or mate and he DID
declind the c7 pawn. Perhaps Fritz is starting to understand the
position more with the new version? The other good alternative
was 17. Qa6 with  h5 to follow and white's comfortable all around
the board. If the greedy and bad 17.  Nxe6? Qxe6 18. Qxc7 Qa6!
19. Bb4 Rec8 20. Qa5 Qd3! 21. Rd1 Qc2 22. Qa6 Ng4 23. Qe2
Qa4 24. Qb2 f4 25. exf4 (25. Qb3 Qa6 is also wonderful for black)
e3! 26. fxe3 Nxe3 and the proof is in the pudding.}
17...Bf7 18. Rb3?
{It's a completely understandable mistake. Fritz is striving for bishop
activity. 18. c6? can't be played because the a3 bishop would be
hanging. Therefore Fritz logically defends it which allows him to
play c6. Fritz is forgetting about his more important minor piece!
The f4 knight. It was imperitive to play 18. h5 to prevent any
exchange of the f4 knight by Nh5 for instance. Once the knight goes
the kingside belongs to black and Kramnik will haven no trouble
redirecting his forces.}
18...Rec8
{Threatening 19...c6! to prevent white's freeing move c6.}
19. c6
{Natural.}
19...Qd8 20. Qa6 Nh5!
{From this point on, Black has good counterplay on the kingside.
What's the strategy called? Development! After the f4 knight
leaves the kingside black has a lead in development over on the
kingside. Black can build an initiative. All black's forces are out
to pasture on the queenside. While white attempts to win the
a-pawn Black will be attempting to win the white king!}
21. Nxh5 Bxh5 22. Rb7?!
{This has the greedy motive behind it against the a7 pawn.
The a7 pawn is worthless though, more important is undermining
the key pawn at d5! I believe 22. c4!? would be much to Fritz's
advantage. Once the center opens, Fritz will have a raw
calculating advantage as the position would be very tacitcal
despite white giving back some material. For instance, 22. c4!?
Bf7 23. cxd5 Bxd5 24. Rb7 Qe8 25. 0-0 if 25...Bxc6 then simply
26. Rb2 Bd5 27. Rc1 Qf7 28. Rbc2 f4 29. Qd6! and white has
solved the potential kingside initiative while retaining the better
of the two pawn structures. After all the trades for instance
29...fxe3 30. fxe3 cxd6 31. Rxc8+ Rxc8 32. Rxc8+ Qg8 33. Rxg8+
Kxg8 34. Bxd6 Bxa2 35. Kf2 and it should be draw as Fritz's
bishop controls the a-pawn's queening square. A draw would be
much better than the game result!}
22...Qf6!
{With the white knight gone, black starts his redeployment of
forces on the kingside. No white pieces are in position to defend the
white king! The more passive 22...Be8?! sucuumbs to 23. c4! The
idea of Be8 of course is to work with Qf6 against the c-pawn. I like
the text. The bishop is nicely placed at h5 and there's no real
reason to retreat it. For instance after 22...Be8?! 23. c4! dxc4
24. Qxc4 Qf6 then 25. d5! and c6 is granite anyway.}
23. 0-0
{For once Fritz is worried more about king safety!}
23...h6!?
{This makes a place for the king at h7 so as to not get mated on
the 1st or second rank. This was very important, of course. For
instance if Kramnik immediately plays 23...Bf3!? which is reasonable
even here, then a line might occur like 23...Bf3! 24. gxf3 exf3 25. Rfb1
Qxh4, but 26. Qd3! Qh3 27. Qf1 Qg4+ 28. Kh2 Qh4+ 29. Qh3
30. Kh1 Re8 31. Rxc7 and if the natural rook lift 31...Re6 (idea e6-g6)
then 32. Rxg7! h6 33. Qxf5 Qh4+ 34. Kg1 f2+ 35. Kf1 Qh1+
36. Kxf2 Qh2+ 37. Kf3 Rxe3+ 38. Kxe3 Re8+ and black can only
delay mate on the back rank or second rank by checks. This is a
very important move from that standpoint.}
24. Bc5
{Greedy, Greedy. Much better is 24. g3!? where Bf3 has no threat
because the h4 pawn is solid and white could simply continue with
25. Rfb1 etc. with advantage. Therefore a line might be 24. g3!?
Kh7 25. Rfb1 Qe6 (eyeing c4) 26. c4 dxc4 27. Qa5 if black tries
to hold on to the c4-pawn with 27...Bf7 then 28. Rxc7 Rxc7 29. Qxc7
Rc8 30. Qxa7 Rxc6 31. Rb7 Ra6 32. Qc5 Ra8 33. Bb4!? Qg6
34. a3 Qh5 35. Be1 Kg8 36. a4! Rf8 37. Bb4 Ra8 38. a5 Qd1+
39. Kh2 Qf3 40. Be1 and white has the d-pawn and a-pawn and
not even the f4 break is enough for black.}
24...Kh7 25. Bxa7 Qxh4
{This is the beginning of the end. Now that the h4 pawn is gone,
black has a very strong sac Bf3! to effectively end the game.}
26. Rfb1 Bf3!
{Very strong. This natural sac probably wasn't found by the computer,
else it would've done something about it earlier.}
27. Qf1
{Of course if 27. gxf3 exf3 28. Qd3 Rf8! 29. Qd1 (only move) Qh5
30. Bb8 (intending use of b8-h2 diagonal to defend) Raxb8 and the
game's simply over.}
27...Re8 28. Bb8!?
{Fritz finds the only way to defend. The idea is to take c7 with the
bishop and use the diagonal to help defend.}
28...Raxb8! 29. Rxb8 Re6!
{Coming to g6 decisively.}
30. Rf8 Rg6 31. Rxf5 Rxg2+ 32. Qxg2 Bxg2 33. Kxg2 Qg4+
{And that's the point of the combination. The rook on f5 is now
black's. This was a stunning and gorgeous win by the world
champ against the flagship chessbase chess engine. This proves
that some humans can still excel over computers in tactics!}

{Analyzed by ?.
Round 1 (Tournament still going on right now)
First a note. I felt obligated to my good friend Sofi to analyze some of
her great games in this tournament. I helped her prepare a little bit by
playing various openings against her at KasparovChess so she could
get a wide variety of play experience. I also gave a lecture which she
helped me give of Kasparov-Korchnoi back in Linares a couple years
back. Therefore, it was obvious she was very well-versed in the style
of this wonderful, still energetic veteran, Viktor Korchnoi. Unfortunately,
she lost this 1st round game, but the battle was nice and she missed
a win. Viktor dragged it to a lost endgame for white after good play from
both sides. This proves how one slip can hurt your winning chances.}
1. e4 e6
{No surprise here. The wonderful veteran playing the black pieces is
the French extraordinair of the 20th and perhaps the 21st century! :)
I know Sofi, and this was the first line she prepared extensively for!}
2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5
{Sofi's pet variation against the French from the white side. She never
opted (at least not that I remember) for 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 etc. with
slower spatial play. She's more of a tactician hoping for the open
game.}
4...Be7!?
{Apparently, this hadn't gone unnoticed by the veteran. This forces white
to play e5 and close up the game. 4...dxe4 was undoubtedly what Sofi
was hoping for, however I'm sure she prepared for this.}
5. e5 Nfd7 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. f4 a6
{This idea Viktor uses is not new by any means. 7...a6!? has the idea of
pushing to b5 and bringing the bishop out on b7. It's a solid line, which
doesn't waste time as it may seem with the wing pawn advance. Why
is that exactly? I thought we were taught that all unneeded wing pawn
advances are a waste of time? However, tempo has a less binding
effect in the closed game. This position is very closed. The kings don't
"need" to get to safety immediately, the development of pieces
quickly is not quite as important as staking out space with pawns in
this type of game. Therefore, 4...a6 is a useful strategic move that
doesn't lose tempo to any serious extent.}
8. Nf3 c5 9. Qd2 Nc6 10. dxc5!
{This capture is well timed. Because the e5 pawn is covered solidly by
its counterpart at f4 it's ok that the d-pawn leave e5's defense. More
importantly this profits white the nice d4 square to plop a knight when
the time is right. Note that after Sofi's 10th move there are no pawns
that can currently chase away the knight at d4.}
10...Qxc5 11. Bd3 b5 12. a3!
{The best move. Natural would seem 12. Ne2 gaining total control over
d4, however 12. Ne2 succumbs to 12...b4! This nice move prevents
c3 and targets the c2 pawn rather effectively. after 13. a3 Qb6! and
white's king is stuck in the center for some time. Therefore, it's
imperitve that white prevent b4. Sofi does just that.}
12...Bb7 13. Qf2
{This is still theory. This is obviously a needed move. The black queen
at her current post is far too menacing. Also played before was 13. b4?!
This possibly natural move is very, very bad. This weakens a whole row
of squares on the c-file. The plan for black would hardly be difficult then.
I like Sofi's choice a lot. The queen exchange would definitely benefit
her. If 13. Ne2?! then simply 13...Qb6! (13...b4!? is possible too) and
black's just fine once again. He'll simply continue with Rc8 and Nc5 with
a wonderful position. It's impertive that Sofi get her queen on that diagonal.}
13...b4!
{Black need not initiate the queen exchange! This move fights for advantage.
The useful 13...h6 intending g5 isn't really an option either because then
simply 14. h4! b4 15. Na4 Qxf2 16. Kxf2 a5 17. g4 with advantage for white.
After the text Black stands as it is very active.}
14. Na4 Qxf2+
{Now he must make this exchange. 14. Qa5? just gets in the way of his
queenside pawns.}
15. Kxf2 a5 16. Bb5!?
{This move is "ok". However, unless she intends to take on c6 it doesn't
have much of a point. 16. Rac1 seems more natural intending c2-c4.
The immediate 16. c4!? is also possible, but let's not jump the gun. A
move like 16. Nd2 also intending c4 allows 16...g5! Therefore 16. Rac1
seems called for.}
16...Ke7!
{The best move. After the queens are exchange black rightly sees there's
no need to castle.}
17. Rhd1 Rhc8 18. c4!
{Now we're talking Sofi! I was proud of my friend here. The bishop doesn't
have a "big" chance of being trapped at b5, but, what does it do there?
After this move, white's options increase dramatically and it gets rid of a
weak pawn. In fact this is the only white move to keep an advantage!}
18...bxc3 {ADDED!!! e.p. } 19. bxc3!
{Now, white has the b-file and a strong hold on d4. This is a fine trade-off
for the newly weak c-pawn.}
19...Rab8 20. Rab1
{Here, 20. c4?! is interesting, but a positional mistake. The important
feature in the position is the d4 square. Anyway with the pawn on c3,
after Nd4 if Nxd4 then cxd4 fixing the pawn structure anyway. I like
Sofi's decision of leaving the pawn on c3. White has a slight advantage.}
20...Ba8 21. Nd4 f6?
{Very natural. In fact, in all honesty, this was the first move I looked at
here. But this could be the losing mistake and prove Sofi's earlier
16. Bb5 correct. More sensible is 21...Rc7.}
22. exf6+?!
{I'm sure that Sofi saw 22. Bxc6, however I think she underestimated
its power. It totally solidifies the knight at d4 and trades into a won
endgame. For instance, 22. Bxc6 Bxc6 23. Rxb8 Nxb8 24. exf6 Kxf6
25. Nb6 Re8 26. Rb1 g6 27. g3 with big advantage. The black forces
are tied down to e6, white still has total control over the d4 square, and
black's bishop is bad. Sofi, most likely by instinct, and fear of how Viktor
would respond, played 22. exf6+ intending to hold on to the bishop pair.
Because of this choice, I have no idea why Sofi played 16. Bb5.}
22...Nxf6 23. Bd3
{Now 24. Bxc6 is bad as black's knight is already on f6. 24. Bxc6? would
just give up Sofi's good bishop. At least Sofi's consistent. :)}
23...e5!
{Powerful. Immediately equalizes and probably earns black the advantage.
This trades off the weak e-pawn.}
24. fxe5 Nxe5 25. Bf5
{The only move to hold the balance.}
25...Rf8 26. Ke2
{Sofi bringing the king slowly but surely over to defend c3 while getting off
of the f-file where a rook is aimed right at his majesty. I liked 26. Rb6!?
This looked strong because 26...Rxb6 exchanging rooks would be to white's
advantage then. Therefore after 26...Nc4 27. Re6+ Kf7 28. Ra6 g6 29. Be6+
Ke7 30. Ke2 Nh5 31. g3 Nf6 32. Rf1 Bb7 33. Ra7 Kd6 34. Rb1 Ba8 35. Ra6+
Ke7 36. Rxb8 Rxb8 37. Nc5 Ne8  38. Ra7+ Kd6 39. Ne4+! with an endgame
advantage.}
26...g6!
{The best move! It's imperitive that Viktor dislodges this strong f5 bishop.}
27. Bd3 Nxd3
{Black earns himself a bishop vs. knight ending and strong control
over the e4 square.}
28. Kxd3 Ne4 29. Re1 Rfc8 30. Nf3?!
{I think better is 30. Ne2.}
30...Kd6 31. Nd4 Bc6!
{The most important move of the game! This is the move that wins. 32. Rb5
is a strong threat. I'm not sure what his time management was like, but
I think this must've been one his longer thinks as this is the beginning of
his winning move sequence.}
32. Rxb8 Rxb8 33. Nxc6 Kxc6 34. c4
{The only move.}
34...dxc4+ 35. Kxc4 Nd6+ 36. Kc3 Nb5+ 37. Kb3 Kd5
{Now the black king has a nice central position, black has the b-file, which
means that the king can't defend the a3 pawn unless it wants to be trapped.}
38. Nc3+ Nxc3 39. Kxc3 a4
{Now the king is officially cut off from defense of the a-pawn and the b3
square is secure for the black rook.}
40. Re7?
{This doesn't help matters for Sofi. Better was 40. Rd1+.}
40...Rb3+ 41. Kc2 Rxa3 42. Rxh7 Ra2+ 43. Kb1 Rxg2 44. h4 Ke6!
{The best move. Black let's go of the a-pawn and concentrates on the
kingside and converting his g-pawn.}
45. h5 g5 46. Ra7 Rh2 47. Rxa4 Kf5 48. Kc1 g4 49. Ra5+ Kf4 50. Ra4+
Kg5 51. Kd1 g3
{No stopping the g-pawn.}
52. Ra8 Kxh5 53. Rg8 Kh4 54. Ke1 Rf2 55. Rh8+ Kg4 56. Rh1 Rh2
{And Sofi resigned. There's no stopping the g-pawn conversion and
subsequent mate. Sofi played a nice game, missed some winning
chances, but I'm proud of her. As a matter of fact she went on to beat
another strong veteran Smyslov in the 3rd round with a quick 22-mover.}
